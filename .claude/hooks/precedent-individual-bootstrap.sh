# Claude Code adapter: SessionStart hook that makes a privately-scoped
# individual practice source resolvable with zero manual steps on Claude
# Code on the web/remote. Install to
# .claude/hooks/precedent-individual-bootstrap.sh (see
# spec/BOOTSTRAP_NEW_SOURCES.md and INSTALL.md step 9's individual-source
# branch -- tools/precedent_bootstrap_source.py's --write-session-hook
# instantiates this file for you, substituting the two variables below).
#
# All real logic lives in the vendored, harness-neutral
# tools/precedent_source_bootstrap.py (practice: session-bootstrap;
# practice: engine-plus-host-shims) -- keep this wrapper free of content,
# the same discipline templates/harness/claude-code/hooks/session-start.sh
# already uses for the general-purpose bootstrap, so an improvement to the
# self-heal mechanism reaches every adopter through the ordinary
# process/upstream/ sync rather than a hand-edit repeated per repo.
#
# WHY A RETRY LOOP IN *THIS HOOK* CANNOT CLOSE THE ACCESS GAP (corrected
# 2026-09-06 -- an earlier version of this file claimed it could). This
# hook needs the session to already have git read access to a private
# repo, and that access is granted per session by the AGENT calling
# `add_repo` as its own first tool call, in its own turn. A `SessionStart`
# hook runs *entirely to completion* before that turn starts -- Claude
# Code's own docs for this hook: synchronous mode "guarantees dependencies
# are installed before your session starts". That is a strict ordering,
# not a race with variable odds: on a genuinely fresh session, EVERY
# attempt this hook could make, at any retry count or delay, runs before
# `add_repo` can have been called even once. Retrying here was tried and
# proven inert by direct test, not merely unhelpful in theory -- see
# tools/precedent_source_bootstrap.py's own docstring for the full
# incident and correction. What actually closes the gap is
# tools/precedent_resolve.py's lazy self-heal: it re-invokes this same
# hook later, from inside the agent's own turn, after `add_repo` has
# actually run -- at which point this hook's own single attempt succeeds
# normally.

# WHOSE individual set. An individual set belongs to ONE person, but this
# hook is committed to a SHARED project -- so the account baked in at
# instantiation is right for whoever installed it and wrong for everyone
# else on the same project, who each have their own set under their own
# account. PRECEDENT_INDIVIDUAL_REPO lets each person point this at theirs
# without editing a tracked file (and without a second, conflicting hook).
#
# The NAME is deliberately not overridable: practice source-naming fixes it
# as the same string in every person's own account, so only the account --
# that is, the URL -- can legitimately differ.
#
# Set it in whatever your environment uses for per-session variables; on
# Claude Code Remote that is the environment's own configuration. Leave it
# unset and you get the project's default, which is the behaviour every
# install had before this existed.
# NAMING A PLACEHOLDER IN PROSE. No comment in this file may spell a
# placeholder out, because the substituter rewrites every occurrence in the
# file -- comments included -- so an explanation of the placeholder comes
# out of instantiation as an explanation of the value ("<the URL> is
# substituted at install time with a real URL"). Prose here calls them the
# source-repo-url and the substituted-sentinel placeholders instead; the
# only literal occurrences are the two lines that actually get substituted.
#
# RESOLUTION ORDER, and why the baked-in default is LAST rather than the
# only option. The source-repo-url placeholder is substituted at install
# time with a real URL, into a file the consuming repo TRACKS. In a public
# consumer that
# publishes the existence and location of somebody's private practice set --
# on the very commit that installs the convenience, and in the same repo
# whose own AGENTS.md typically states that naming it "would leak its
# existence and location". Found 2026-09-07 in a real public consumer that
# said exactly that, five lines from the URL.
#
# The private location belongs in the private file. `~/.config/precedent/
# config.json` is per-person and never tracked anywhere -- it is already
# where the individual source is declared, for this same reason -- so its
# `individual.repo_url` is read first, and a public consumer needs no URL in
# its tree at all.
#
# The NAME is deliberately not overridable: practice source-naming fixes it
# as the same string in every person's own account, so only the account --
# that is, the URL -- can legitimately differ.

# HOW THIS FILE KNOWS ITS BAKED-IN DEFAULT IS REAL (corrected 2026-09-10).
# Until that date the guard below asked whether $REPO_URL still equalled
# the source-repo-url placeholder. That question can never be answered
# correctly from inside this file, because the substituter rewrites EVERY
# occurrence of that placeholder here -- the one inside the guard included.
# So an instantiated hook compared the real URL against itself, found them
# equal, and took the "no repository URL" exit on every single session,
# while holding the correct URL. Every hook ever written with a real
# --repo-url was silently inert; the resolver's lazy self-heal could not
# save it either, since the self-heal re-invokes this same hook. Found
# installing precedent-beta-v01 into a real project.
#
# A SEPARATE sentinel fixes it. The substituted-sentinel placeholder on the
# `if` line below becomes the literal `yes` at instantiation and stays a
# placeholder in the template, so "has this file been instantiated?" is
# asked of a value whose two states cannot collide with any URL a person
# legitimately has. An instantiation that deliberately bakes in NO url (the
# right shape for a public consumer, per the paragraph above) leaves the
# default empty and is still correctly instantiated -- which is the second
# reason the sentinel has to be its own placeholder rather than the URL's
# own value.

# LAST RESORT, and the reason a public repo need bake in no account at all.
# The set's NAME is fixed by level -- `precedent-individual` for every
# person, never chosen (practice: source-naming) -- so the only unknown is
# the ACCOUNT, and $PRECEDENT_SOURCE_BASE_URL already carries it for the
# team sets. Deriving the individual set the same way means a tracked hook
# in a public tree names nobody.
#
# THE INCIDENT (2026-09-10). INSTALL.md section 8 states plainly that no
# tracked file names the account owning the private sets -- that is why the
# base URL is an environment variable. It was true of the team sets and
# false of this one: the upstream repo's own instantiated copy of this hook
# carried a full `https://github.com/<account>/precedent-individual` in a
# tracked file, on a public branch, five lines from the comment above
# explaining that a public consumer should bake in no URL. Every repo that
# instantiated this hook inherited the same shape and published its own
# owner's account the same way (practice: affordance-is-shared -- the
# defect was shared exactly as widely as the mechanism).
# `${VAR:-}` on both reads, not `$VAR`: this hook runs under `set -u`, and
# the first version of this block took the whole session-start hook down
# with "PRECEDENT_SOURCE_BASE_URL: unbound variable" on any machine that had
# not set it -- which is every machine the derivation exists to serve.
# Caught by verify_harness.py's existing assertion that this hook exits 0
# when it cannot reach the individual set.
