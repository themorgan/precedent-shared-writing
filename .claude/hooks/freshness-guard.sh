# Claude Code adapter: never work on, or write to, a stale checkout.
#
# practice: session-bootstrap
#
# Install to .claude/hooks/freshness-guard.sh, wired twice by the
# adapter's settings.json -- once as SessionStart, once as PreToolUse.
# The rule it implements -- verify and fast-forward the checkout before a
# session's first write, never after -- is not yet a universal practice
# here: promoting one is a separate, reviewed step. This is the mechanism,
# installed ahead of that.
#
# Two modes, wired as two different hooks in a project's own
# .claude/settings.json (see this adapter's own settings.json for the
# canonical wiring):
#
#   freshness-guard.sh session-start [BASE]
#       A SessionStart hook. Fetches, fast-forwards the current branch when
#       that is provably lossless, and warns about anything it cannot fix.
#       ALWAYS exits 0: a hook that can wedge a session over a freshness
#       question is a worse failure than the staleness it is guarding
#       against (fail-gracefully, same contract as
#       the adapter's session-start.sh).
#
#   freshness-guard.sh user-prompt [BASE]
#       A UserPromptSubmit hook, for the case neither of the others reach:
#       a session left open across a break. SessionStart fires once, at the
#       start; pre-write fires once, at the first write -- so a tab that has
#       been open for hours, and already made its first edit, is never
#       rechecked no matter how far origin moves underneath it.
#       This mode runs the session-start checks again, THROTTLED: it does
#       nothing at all unless the last check is older than the interval
#       (default 600s, `git config precedent.freshness.intervalSeconds` to
#       change). Nothing polls and nothing runs in the background -- the
#       hook only exists while a prompt is being submitted, and "idle" is
#       computed there and then by subtracting the stamp file's mtime from
#       now. Measured cost of the skipped path: ~8ms, almost all of it bash
#       starting up, no network, no output, so nothing enters the model's
#       context. The one prompt that pays the ~500ms fetch is the first one
#       back after a break -- exactly the prompt whose checkout might be
#       stale. ALWAYS exits 0: a UserPromptSubmit hook that exits non-zero
#       blocks the message, and losing what someone just typed over a
#       freshness question is far worse than the staleness.
#
#   freshness-guard.sh pre-write [BASE]
#       A PreToolUse hook. Runs its checks ONCE per session -- the first
#       tool call -- and then gets out of the way for the rest of it. On a
#       checkout it cannot vouch for, it exits 2, which is how a PreToolUse
#       hook refuses a tool call and hands its stderr back as the reason.
#
# BASE is the branch this one is meant to sit on top of -- "main" here,
# "precedent-beta-v01" in BestPractice. It is an explicit argument, passed
# in settings.json, on purpose: BestPractice's own configured default
# branch is NOT its base branch, so anything that asks git for the default
# would confidently get the wrong answer there. With no BASE argument the
# script asks git for origin's default and, failing that, SKIPS the base
# check with a note rather than guessing.
#
# WHY THE BASE CHECK EXISTS AT ALL (this is the part that catches the real
# incident). Comparing HEAD against origin/<the same branch name> answers
# "am I behind my own remote", and on a feature branch that is almost
# always "no" -- including on a container whose clone is five days and two
# hundred commits old, where the branch and its remote counterpart agree
# with each other perfectly and are both equally out of date. The question
# that actually catches that is "does my branch already contain everything
# on its base", which is what `merge-base --is-ancestor` answers.
#
# WHY THE FAST-FORWARD IS SAFE. It runs only when all four of: the fetch
# succeeded, the working tree is clean, the branch has nothing origin does
# not (so there is nothing of mine to lose), and there is genuinely
# something to move to. `merge --ff-only` under those conditions cannot
# lose work and cannot produce a conflict -- it either moves the ref or
# refuses. It is deliberately NOT a hard reset (throws away whatever the
# preconditions failed to notice), NOT a rebase (rewrites published
# history -- see BestPractice's no-rewrite-for-warnings), and NOT `git
# pull` (merges or rebases depending on config, and per BestPractice's own
# gotchas log, a pull run inside a checkout someone handed you is exactly
# how a session got silently moved onto the wrong branch mid-work).
#
# WHY THIS NEVER TOUCHES THE BASE BRANCH AUTOMATICALLY. Bringing origin/BASE
# into a feature branch is a real merge with real conflict potential -- the
# opposite of the fast-forward above, which is a no-op or nothing. The
# guard reports it and names the command; a person or an agent runs it
# deliberately.
