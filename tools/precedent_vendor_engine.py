"""precedent_vendor_engine.py — vendors Precedent's engine into a repo that
consumes it, as real tracked files instead of an undocumented hand-copy.
Two KINDS, sharing one mechanism:

  'source'   — an individual or team practice SET (precedent-individual,
               precedent-team-repo-maintenance, precedent-team-tms). Needs
               ENGINE_FILES: enough to run its own AGENTS.md loader block
               (precedent_show.py's Rule/Detail/Why/Story/Install split,
               build_views.py's `--agents-only` regeneration,
               precedent_paths.py's path-trigger channel, precedent_gate.py's
               closed gate vocabulary), AND enough to resolve the person's
               own individual source, since a practice set is a repository
               somebody works in like any other (precedent_source_
               credentials.py, precedent_source_bootstrap.py). This is the
               original, narrower case this tool closed first — see
               spec/BOOTSTRAP_NEW_SOURCES.md.

  'consumer' — a real four-source CONSUMER repo (universal + team +
               individual + repo-local, a vendored process/upstream/, the
               full precedent_materialize.py/precedent_sync_views.py
               toolchain that resolves all of them into one materialized
               tree). Needs CONSUMER_ENGINE_FILES: everything 'source'
               needs, PLUS those materializing tools — see this repo's own
               engine-plus-host-shims practice ("domain-neutral mechanism
               lives in the vendored tree"). Piloted 2026-09-05 against
               a private consumer repo — INSTALL.md §1 step 12 and §2
               step 6 document the consumer-repo procedure this closes.

THE GAP 'source' CLOSED FIRST. tools/precedent_bootstrap_source.py has only
ever written practice content, config, approvers and the leak-blocklist —
never an engine file. Every individual/team set that existed before this
tool got its tools/build_views.py, precedent_gate.py, precedent_paths.py,
precedent_show.py and split_practices.py into place by an undocumented,
one-off hand-copy, so none of them could tell a stale copy from a current
one, and precedent-team-tms's copy was simply missing outright.

THE GAP 'consumer' CLOSES. A real consumer's own tools/ needing the same
treatment was named explicitly as future work when 'source' shipped
(the TODO item that named it — since closed and removed — said: "not
piloted... deliberately not folded into the source-repo fix"). A private consumer repo — a real four-source
consumer, not a fixture — had the identical undocumented-hand-copy problem
'source' closed for practice sets: its top-level tools/ held
build_views.py, precedent_gate.py, precedent_paths.py, precedent_show.py,
split_practices.py, precedent_materialize.py, precedent_resolve.py and
precedent_sync_views.py, all copied in by hand at some point in the past
with no manifest, no recorded source commit, and (confirmed 2026-09-05) six
of those eight files had already drifted from BestPractice's current
tools/ — including the --repo-awareness fix (commit 7c8d33d) and the
repo-local `path: "."` safety fix (commit 29148bc's sibling changes to
precedent_resolve.py/precedent_materialize.py), silently missing from the
consumer's copy the whole time.

Distinct from tools/checkin.py, which mirrors a CONSUMER's whole
process/upstream/ tree, deleting anything the tree no longer has, in BOTH
directions (a consumer pulls upstream content AND pushes its own
check-ins back). This engine is one-directional in both kinds —
downstream from BestPractice only, since neither a source set nor a
consumer's own tools/ has engine code of its own to contribute back — and
it sits inside tools/ ALONGSIDE non-vendored, repo-owned files (tools/checks/,
routing_scope.json is vendored but trimmed, a source set's own
build_codeowners.py, a consumer's own bootstrap.sh/light_check.py/
report_automation_issue.py) that a whole-directory mirror-and-delete would
destroy. So this is a NEW, narrower tool, not an extension of checkin.py:
it touches only the files it knows about, by name, per kind.

ENGINE_FILES / CONSUMER_ENGINE_FILES both name this script itself last, on
purpose: it travels WITH the engine it defines, so a future improvement to
the vendoring mechanism itself reaches every already-vendored repo the same
way an improvement to build_views.py does — not a second, undocumented gap
one layer up from the one this tool closes. precedent_materialize.py and
precedent_sync_views.py are never in ENGINE_FILES (source) — a source set
has no process/upstream/ and materializes nothing — but they ARE in
CONSUMER_ENGINE_FILES, where resolving four sources into one materialized
tree is the entire point.

precedent_resolve.py WAS in that consumer-only group until 2026-09-13, on
the reasoning that a source set has "nothing to resolve against more than
one tree". That half was wrong, and it cost a measured failure: a set
resolves nothing, so its generated occasion index carried its own entries
and not one of universal's 94, and a session rooted there worked with every
universal rule silently absent. A set has exactly one other tree to resolve
against — universal's — and resolving it is how those rules reach the
session. So precedent_resolve.py and precedent_session_practices.py are now
in ENGINE_FILES, and the set reads universal out of an UNTRACKED
.precedent/SESSION_PRACTICES.md rather than a committed copy
(spec/SOURCE_SET_PROSE_GAP.md, shape 3, approved 2026-09-13).

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY IN NEITHER LIST: verify_harness.py, and only it. It is
this repo's own harness for this repo's own engine; a consumer has nothing
for it to verify.

THIS PARAGRAPH USED TO NAME leak_gate.py AND very_deep_check.py TOO, and
that stopped being true on 2026-09-20/21 -- both are vendored now, in
ENGINE_FILES above. The old reasoning was that they "run only from a
BestPractice checkout, against whatever repositories that session can
see", so improving them reached every repo for free. That was accurate
while nobody could run them anywhere else, and it is exactly what made
them unreachable in a consuming repo: a leak gate that only upstream can
run does not guard a downstream tree, and a "Very deep check" a person
says in their own project cannot be carried out.

It is kept here rather than deleted because the incident it records still
teaches: on 2026-09-07 a change to those two tools was written up as
needing a per-set engine refresh, and an item was opened saying the sets
were running stale copies -- of files they had never held. The reasoning
came from cross-source-rollout, a real practice that simply did not apply.
Nobody checked these lists first. CHECK THEM BEFORE COSTING A ROLLOUT, and
note that the answer changed: a claim about this file's contents made from
memory is now wrong in both directions.

routing_scope.json is vendored in both kinds too, but it is not a
byte-identical copy: precedent_gate.py's SCOPE file carries two things in
this repo — the closed GATE vocabulary (`gates`, the moments a practice can
fire at, which is the same everywhere Precedent's loader runs, regardless
of kind) and a `practices` key documenting the routing reason for every one
of BestPractice's OWN 60-odd practices, which has no meaning in either a
source set or a consumer repo with a different catalogue entirely.
`_trim_routing_scope` below keeps only the first and drops the second — the
same trim a prior, undocumented hand-copy already applied by hand to every
repo that needed it (precedent-individual, precedent-team-repo-maintenance, and
and a private consumer repo's own top-level tools/routing_scope.json, all three
confirmed byte-identical to this function's output before this tool
existed, or was extended to the consumer kind); this tool just makes that
trim mechanical instead of a fact only the session that did it once
remembered.

SINCE 2026-09-15, the .claude/hooks/*.sh adapter scripts travel with the
engine too -- seed/status/refresh all cover them alongside tools/, tracked
in the same ENGINE_MANIFEST.json (see the HOOK_SOURCE_DIR block below for
why they are a second, smaller mechanism rather than folded into
ENGINE_FILES). Before this date they were installed once by
precedent_install.py and never refreshed, so a fix landing in a hook script
-- the freshness-guard.sh shallow-clone false-positive, record/GOTCHAS.md#g12,
is the incident that prompted this -- never reached an already-vendored
repo no matter how many times it ran `refresh`. .claude/settings.json itself
is still never touched by this tool, on purpose; see that block.

Five subcommands:

  seed <dest-dir> [--kind source|consumer]
                                  Run from BESTPRACTICE'S OWN checkout (the
                                  case tools/precedent_bootstrap_source.py
                                  needs — no clone required, the source IS
                                  this checkout). --kind defaults to
                                  'source' (unchanged CLI/API for every
                                  existing caller — precedent_bootstrap_
                                  source.py calls seed(dest) with no kind
                                  argument at all, and gets the same
                                  narrower set it always has). Copies the
                                  kind's file list and a trimmed
                                  routing_scope.json into <dest-dir>/tools/,
                                  and writes
                                  <dest-dir>/tools/ENGINE_MANIFEST.json
                                  recording this checkout's HEAD commit,
                                  the kind, and a sha256 per vendored file.

  status <bestpractice-clone>    Run from an ALREADY-VENDORED repo of
                                  either kind (same shape checkin.py's
                                  verbs use): reads `kind` back out of
                                  ENGINE_MANIFEST.json (no --kind flag
                                  needed — the manifest already says which
                                  file list applies) and compares the
                                  vendored files against its recorded
                                  hashes (local hand-edit?) and against the
                                  clone's current tools/ (upstream moved?).
                                  Exit 1 if either differs.

  refresh <bestpractice-clone> [--force] [--from-ref REF]
                                  Same kind auto-detection as status. Pulls
                                  the clone's SOURCE_BRANCH (see below —
                                  NOT the clone's configured default
                                  branch), refuses if a vendored file was
                                  hand-edited since the last seed/refresh
                                  (its sha256 no longer matches
                                  ENGINE_MANIFEST.json) unless --force, then
                                  re-copies + re-trims (the kind's own file
                                  list) and updates the manifest. Also keeps
                                  any file this repo's precedent.json maps
                                  under `engine_paths` (upstream path ->
                                  local path) current; see ENGINE_PATHS_KEY.

  fresh                          Clone-free staleness notice, no argument
                                  needed: one `git ls-remote` of
                                  ENGINE_MANIFEST.json's recorded repo,
                                  compared to the recorded commit. Always
                                  exits 0 (a notice, never a gate); silent
                                  on network failure vs. loud on a fast,
                                  clean failure (checkin.py's fresh() carries
                                  the same distinction and the same reason:
                                  an unreachable remote must never read as
                                  "confirmed fresh").

  record-ci                      Clone-free, like `fresh`: re-baseline THIS

                                  file(s) are on disk right now, for the

                                  the recorded hash. For the moment a CI
                                  workflow file was fixed BY HAND (an
                                  incident too urgent to wait for a
                                  `refresh --force`, which would also
                                  overwrite it back to the generic
                                  template) and now needs the manifest to
                                  stop calling it drifted. Also drops any
                                  RETIRED_CI_WORKFLOW_FILES entry the
                                  manifest still carries.

Run (from an already-vendored repo's own checkout, either kind):
  python3 tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py fresh
  python3 tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py status  ../BestPractice
  python3 tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py refresh ../BestPractice
  python3 tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py record-ci

Run once, from BestPractice's own checkout, to vendor a NEW consumer repo
(status/refresh above then work unchanged, kind auto-detected):
  python3 tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py seed <consumer-repo> --kind consumer

SOURCE_BRANCH is 'precedent-beta-v01', the branch work here lands on, and
every other repo takes its updates from it too, for now, so they all
follow one branch (Morgan, 2026-09-24, strength: decided: "for now, they
should all follow precedent-beta-v01"; "maybe later we'll move them all
to follow main"). It read 'main' for a few hours that day, on an approval
Morgan later described as assent rather than a decision ("That was more an
assent, than a decision. I didn't think about it."), which left the
installs split across two branches. Moving everyone to 'main' later is
this one line plus runbook step 1, changed in the same PR.

# ENGINE_FILES closed for tools/precedent_reply_check.py and

# that lands upstream and never reaches an already-vendored repo because
# nothing carries it there. The freshness-guard.sh shallow-clone false-

# every consumer that vendored before that fix landed would otherwise keep
# hitting it, forever, no matter how many times it ran "Update Vendors".

# every name in `files` resolves inside tools/. A second, smaller, explicitly
# separate mechanism is the honest shape, tracked in the SAME

#
# HOW A HOOK LEAVES A CONSUMER (corrected 2026-09-24; this passage used to
# say no removal existed, which stopped being true on 2026-09-21). A hook
# the previous manifest recorded and upstream no longer ships, or one named
# in RETIRED_HOOK_FILES, is deleted by _remove_dropped_hook_files when its
# hash still matches. An UNTRACKED copy of a RETIRED_HOOK_FILES name --
# vendored before `hook_files` existed -- is deleted by
# retire_legacy_leftovers when its content matches the recogniser and
# nothing in .claude/settings.json still calls it. There is still no
# per-kind hook list: both kinds run the same Claude Code adapter, so every
# hook applies to both. A hook upstream never shipped at all is the repo's
# own and nothing here touches it.
#
# .claude/settings.json is deliberately NOT vendored here.
# precedent_install.py's _harness() already leaves it alone once it exists,
# on purpose -- a consumer may have wired its own extra hooks alongside the

    `precedent_decommission.py` is in the consumer engine set, so renaming it

    WHY THIS IS SAFE, and it rests entirely on the manifest. The only files

    THE GAP THIS CLOSES (found 2026-09-21 by the very deep check's own
    deletion-propagation table, `very-deep-check` pass 2 item 8b; filed as
    todo-2026-09-21-a-dropped-hook-never-leaves-a-consumer.md). Until now
    this engine had exactly two removal paths -- _remove_dropped_engine_
    files for tools/ and _remove_retired_ci_workflow_files for
    .github/workflows/ -- and none for .claude/hooks/. A hook dropped
    upstream stayed installed in every consumer, and _write_hook_files then
    REPLACED `hook_files` with only what it had just written, so the
    manifest entry vanished too: the file went on running, every session,
    recorded by nothing and visible to no check keyed on the manifest.

    That is the CI-workflow asymmetry one directory over, and a hook is the
    worse of the two -- a stale workflow burns a runner minute, a stale hook
    executes in every session of every repo that still carries it.

    WHAT COUNTS AS DROPPED, precisely: a name the PREVIOUS manifest recorded
    that upstream no longer SHIPS. Not "no longer wired here" -- un-wiring
    is the repo's own act and hooks-on-disk-are-reachable already reports
    the orphan it leaves -- and not "claimed by an adapter", which is
    another mechanism maintaining the same path on purpose.

    THE GUARD THIS NEEDS AND THE ENGINE PATH DOES NOT. `available` comes
    from a directory glob, and _hook_file_names returns [] for a directory
    that is not there. An empty upstream hooks/ is indistinguishable from
    "this checkout cannot see upstream", and sweeping on that reading would
    delete every hook in the consumer. So an empty `available` sweeps
    NOTHING, the same refusal _remove_retired_ci_workflow_files makes for an
    unrecognised kind.

# --- Declared engine paths: an upstream file kept at a path of the repo's own
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-09-24). precedent-individual keeps
# `bootstrap/commit-identity.sh` byte-identical to this repo's
# templates/harness/claude-code/hooks/commit-identity.sh, and until now only
# by hand: four sync commits in ten days, each one a session noticing the
# drift. The hooks block above cannot help -- it vendors into .claude/hooks/
# only, and a repo that wires a script from its own path is deliberately
# skipped (_wired_hook_names_anywhere). Moving the file is not an option
# either: this repo's own .claude/hooks/session-start.sh runs
# `<individual set>/bootstrap/commit-identity.sh` by that exact path, and the
# set's precedent.json `adapters` ships it to consumers FROM there, so the
# path is load-bearing in two places and deleting it fails silently in both.
#
# So the repo DECLARES the mapping, in its own precedent.json:
#
#     "engine_paths": {
#       "templates/harness/claude-code/hooks/commit-identity.sh":
#         "bootstrap/commit-identity.sh"
#     }
#
# upstream path (in this repo's tree) -> local path (in the declaring repo).
# `refresh` then copies it like any engine file, records its sha256 in
# ENGINE_MANIFEST.json (`engine_paths`/`engine_paths_sha256`), and a
# hand-edit is drift, refused without --force, exactly as for tools/.
#
# Four rules, each closing a way this could hurt:
#
#   * NO SECOND WRITER. A local path an adapter already writes (an adapter's
#     TO, per _adapter_claimed_paths) or one this engine already vendors is
#     refused, whatever --force says: two mechanisms owning one file is the
#     double-maintenance that reads as a hand-edit later. An adapter's FROM
#     is fine -- that is precedent-individual's case, and consumers are
#     unaffected because the adapter still copies from the same place.
#   * FIRST RUN ADOPTS, NEVER OVERWRITES. With no hash recorded yet, a local
#     file identical to upstream is adopted silently; a different one is
#     refused with a count of differing lines, EVEN UNDER --force. --force
#     means "discard the edit I was told about"; on a first run nobody has
#     been told anything yet. It also has to hold under refresh's own second
#     pass, which re-runs with --force whenever the tool replaced itself --
#     which is exactly the run that first acts on a new declaration.
#   * AN UPSTREAM FILE THAT VANISHED IS KEPT. Warned about, loudly, on every
#     refresh that reaches the write step; the local copy and its record
#     stay. Deleting a repo's own-path file on a routine refresh is a larger
#     decision than this makes.
#   * A DROPPED DECLARATION HANDS THE FILE BACK. It stops being tracked and
#     becomes the repo's own, left on disk and said once.

# --- CI workflow files: templates/github-actions/*.template ----------------
# Distinct from the tools/ engine files and the .claude/hooks/ scripts above
# in the same two ways HOOK_SOURCE_DIR's own comment names for itself: a
# different source directory (templates/github-actions/, not tools/) and a
# different destination (.github/workflows/, not tools/ or .claude/hooks/).
# Until 2026-09-18 these files were installed ONCE -- precedent_install.py's
# _bootstrap_and_ci and precedent_bootstrap_source.py's _install_workflows
# both write `if not wf.exists() or force`, never on an ordinary refresh --
# so "Update Vendors" never re-copied the template body into an
# already-installed file. Reached a real consumer this way: doc-lint.yml.
# template's `concurrency:` block (2026-09-15) reached an already-installed
# bestpractice-docs.yml only when that repo reinstalled from scratch, and
# spec/CI_MINUTES_PLAN.md's Phase C debounce-guard step (added the next day)
# never reached it at all -- the same class of gap the hooks block above
# closed for .claude/hooks/*.sh on 2026-09-15.
#
# KIND-SPECIFIC, unlike the hooks above (which vendor the SAME scripts into
# both kinds, narrowed only by what a repo's own settings.json wires). A
# consumer installs bestpractice-docs.yml from doc-lint.yml.template; a
# source set installs precedent-check.yml (which since 2026-09-19 also
# carries the views-drift check as one of its jobs -- see
# templates/github-actions/precedent-check.yml.template's own header,
# spec/CI_MINUTES_PLAN.md item 9) from its own template --
# CI_WORKFLOW_TEMPLATES is the one place that pairing is declared, so
# precedent_bootstrap_source.py's own WORKFLOW_TEMPLATES reuses it rather
# than repeating it (practice: registry-source-of-truth).
#
# Both are gated on `ci_workflows` at the point they are WRITTEN
# (precedent_install.py's / precedent_bootstrap_source.py's own
# `_ci_preference`) -- nothing below this line asks that question again. A
# file this kind's list names but that is not present on disk is simply not
# this mechanism's business: correctly absent because CI is declined, same
# as always.
#
# THE CATCH-UP IS DELIBERATELY DIFFERENT FROM THE HOOKS ONE ABOVE. A hook
# script is engine code this repo ships as an unmodified adapter -- "this
# engine has no local variance by design" -- so the hooks catch-up
# overwrites an untracked one outright. A CI workflow YAML is exactly the
# kind of file a real repo hand-tunes (an extra job, a changed schedule, a
# repo-specific secret), so the first refresh after this shipped must not
# silently discard that. `_refresh_ci_workflow_files` below records a
# baseline hash for an untracked file and leaves its content alone; only a
# LATER refresh, once that baseline exists, can tell "matches what we
# recorded" from "hand-edited" and act on it.

    # MEASURED, from his own GitHub usage export for that day. 127 of 143
    # billed minutes -- 89% -- came from four practice sets running these
    # two workflows. The twelve CONSUMING repos, all on the one-job
    # light-check, cost 16 minutes between them. The sets' share had gone
    # 2% -> 89% in eleven days while the absolute number stayed flat,
    # because every Update Vendors pass pushes a branch to four repos and
    # each push fires both workflows in each.
    #
    # WHY A SOURCE IS THE RIGHT PLACE TO STOP. Every change to a set
    # arrives through a session that runs the full gate suite before it
    # pushes -- the deep check is what gates a push (two-check-levels), and
    # the commit gate already ran doc_lint. CI there re-checks a tree that
    # was checked seconds earlier by the same tools. And most of what it
    # runs does not apply: a set carries few of the practices the registry
    # binds, so precedent-check SKIPS most of its catalogue there, which is
    # how two real sets came to report `0 passed` on an ordinary commit.
    # We were paying per-job minutes, rounded up, for a second opinion that
    # was mostly skips.
    #
    # A CONSUMER IS DIFFERENT and keeps its leak gate. A consuming repo can
    # receive a contribution from a fork, whose pushes never fire `push` in
    # the receiving repository -- so without the workflow a contributed
    # branch reaches it unscanned. A source set is single-owner and takes
    # no forks.

    # The empty tuple is not an oversight and is READ as a decision:
    # _remove_retired_ci_workflow_files sweeps whatever a kind no longer
    # ships, and only for a kind it recognises, so `source` being present

# views-drift.yml.template was folded into precedent-check.yml.template as
# its own job (spec/CI_MINUTES_PLAN.md item 9), and the four repos that hand-
# applied that fix the same day deleted the now-redundant views-drift.yml
# file -- but nothing told refresh() the old entry was retired, so
# ci_workflows_sha256 kept recording a hash for a file that no longer
# existed. _ci_workflow_drift reads "recorded, but missing on disk" as a
# hand-edit needing --force, so the NEXT refresh() in that repo would have
# refused entirely over a file the fix had already, correctly, removed --
# not the file-content drift that check exists to catch.
#
# WHY A TOMBSTONE, MIRRORING RETIRED_ENGINE_FILES, RATHER THAN JUST DIFFING
# CI_WORKFLOW_TEMPLATES. A name gone from the current mapping is ambiguous
# on its own: it could mean "retired, fold its job into the survivor" (safe
# to stop tracking) or "a repo's own tools/ vendored an older engine that
# still lists a file dropped since" (nothing to clean up, this repo simply
# has not refreshed yet). Naming the retirement explicitly, with the reason,
# is what makes automatic cleanup safe to do unconditionally rather than
# guessing from absence.
#
# WHY THIS DELETES THE FILE WHEN IT IS SAFE TO, as of 2026-09-20 --
# mirroring _remove_dropped_engine_files for an ordinary tools/*.py engine
# file, not this mechanism's original "never deletes" design. refresh()'s
# own comment on ci_incomplete still holds the reason a retired workflow
# file is never deleted UNCONDITIONALLY: "deleting somebody's
# .github/workflows/*.yml out from under them on a routine refresh is a
# different, larger decision than this fix makes." What changed is that
# _remove_retired_ci_workflow_files (below) now only ever deletes a copy
# whose on-disk content still matches the hash the manifest last recorded
# for it -- the untouched, stock retired template, and nothing else. A
# hand-edited copy, or one the manifest never recorded a hash for, is kept
# and reported exactly as before; only the manifest's stale tracking entry
# is ever dropped unconditionally. Raised by Morgan
# ("shouldn't we delete the files? ... it creates confusion and complexity
# and risk and cost") against a live incident: a fresh usage-report pull
# found several personal repos still billing real minutes against files
# this mechanism already knew were retired. This closes the half of that
# gap this mechanism can reach going forward -- a FUTURE rename/fold, the
# same way views-drift.yml's own retirement was. It does NOT retroactively
# clean up a file that predates this tombstone system entirely (nothing
# ever recorded a hash for it to compare against) -- see
# spec/CI_MINUTES_PLAN.md's Phase B sweep for that half.

    WHY THIS EXISTS, and why the two escapes that already existed are not
    escapes. A consuming repo may have a genuine reason to diverge one
    vendored workflow -- 2026-09-21's case was an identity fold plus a
    deliberate note about a flag the repo does not want. `refresh` refuses,
    correctly, because it cannot tell that edit from an accident. But both
    routes out DESTROY the divergence: `--force` overwrites it on the spot,
    and `record-ci` re-baselines the hash so the NEXT refresh overwrites it
    silently, which is worse. The session that hit it swapped the template
    in, ran the refresh, and put the file back by hand -- a manoeuvre that
    works exactly once and leaves nothing behind for the next person, who
    will meet the same wall with no hint that anyone has been here.

    nobody has to justify, which is how an exemption stops being read; an
    entry with an empty reason is ignored, exactly as if it were absent,
    and refresh says so rather than honouring it silently.

    A declared file is then: never overwritten, never drift, never
    "untracked" -- and PRINTED ON EVERY RUN with its reason, so the
    exemption stays visible instead of becoming invisible infrastructure.

    the SAME standard, not a weaker one invented for this function. It does
    NOT prove the file was never hand-edited at any point in its history:
    someone could have edited it and then run `record-ci` to accept that
    edit as correct (exactly what that subcommand exists for), which
    updates the recorded hash to match the edit. If that same file's

    closed here.

    A path this function never even considers: one ci_workflows_sha256 has

# --- Leftovers of the pre-Precedent install, recognised by CONTENT
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (Morgan, 2026-09-24, strength: decided): "this needs to be
# deleted from ALL installs, the migration to the new precedent should [have]
# deleted this." Measured the same day in six of his installs: the old
# install's workflows survived in five of them, a month after migration.
#
# WHY THE TWO REMOVERS ABOVE NEVER SAW THEM. _remove_retired_ci_workflow_files
# and _remove_dropped_hook_files only consider a path the manifest recorded,
# and only while its hash still matches. An install older than that tracking
# recorded nothing, and a hand-paused copy no longer matches, so both kinds
# were structurally invisible: `bestpractice-docs.yml` had been retired for
# three days and was still in all five installs that had it -- two tracked but
# hand-paused, three never tracked at all.
#
# WHY CONTENT AND NEVER THE NAME. Every copy of these files differs (four
# installs, four different `bestpractice-upstream-sync.yml`s), so no single
# hash can recognise them. And a name alone has already deleted live checks:
# the 2026-09-20 sweep trusted a filename and took out nine
# (spec/CI_MINUTES_PLAN.md item 14), `light-check.yml` among them, which is a
# LIVE check in most installs. So a path is deleted only when its content has
# the old install's structural shape, and a file with the name but not the
# shape is kept and reported for a person to read. `light-check.yml` is on no
# list here at all.
#
# WHAT IS REUSED RATHER THAN FORKED. precedent_decommission.py's refusals
# about the file itself (untracked, uncommitted edits, a live trigger) and its
# registry, process/decommissioned_paths.json. Its reference search is NOT
# applied as a refusal, the same call dependents_of() makes for every other
# refresh deletion: a consumer's materialized practices/ names every retired
# workflow by design, so that refusal would fire every time and delete
# nothing. The references are reported instead.

    and the blind spot is not hypothetical. 2026-09-06, in
    precedent-team-repo-maintenance: its engine was a faithful, internally
    consistent vendoring of one upstream commit -- seven files, every hash
    matching -- and beside it sat a hand-copied `build_codeowners.py` from a
    LATER upstream commit. build_views.py scans `tools/*.py` and requires a
    description for each, so the newer stray broke the older engine outright:
    `build_views.py` failed, and that repo could not regenerate its own
    AGENTS.md at all. Every mechanism reported healthy -- `status` compared
    only recorded files and saw no drift -- because the one file causing it
    was invisible to all of them.

    Deliberately keyed on the engine's OWN file lists rather than on "any
    .py we did not vendor": a repo's own tools/ legitimately holds its own
    scripts, and flagging those would make this noise. A name that appears
    in ENGINE_FILES or CONSUMER_ENGINE_FILES but not in this repo's manifest
    is the precise signature of a hand-drop -- and `refresh` is its fix,
    since vendoring the file properly is exactly what records it."""

    `refresh` updates the ENGINE and nothing else, by design -- taking the
    practice catalogue is a separate, deliberate step (INSTALL.md section 2),
    because installs are adapted and an unattended mirror is the mechanism
    class that loses content. The cost of that separation is a skew nobody
    was told about: engine code that cites a practice slug the vendored
    catalogue predates.

    THE REMEDY THIS NOTICE NAMES IS DELIBERATELY NOT `checkin.py update`.
    Its first version suggested exactly that, and the suggestion was worse
    than silence: checkin.py's `_default_branch()` resolves
    `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` unconditionally, so on every consumer pinned
    to `precedent-beta-v01` -- which is all of them, until the phase-7
    fold-in -- following the advice mirrors `main` over the vendored tree
    and DELETES the very practices this notice says are missing. Caught
    2026-09-06 by the consumer session that read the notice, recognized the
    trap, and did the manual mirror instead; spec/MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md's
    "The default-branch gotcha" is the same finding from the other side.
    UPDATE, later the same day: checkin.py HAS since been taught the pin.
    All four of its commands -- `fresh`, `update`, `record`, `push` -- now
    read `upstream.branch` from the consuming repo's own
    `process/manifest.json` and fall back to the clone's default only when
    no pin is recorded, and `record` no longer checks the clone out either.
    Seven harness cases assert it, each with a negative control.

    The remedy named below still points at the manual mirror anyway, and
    that is a deliberate hold rather than an oversight. What these two
    documents guard against is an UNATTENDED job overwriting a repo's
    vendored tree; the fix that would let them relax is hours old at the
    time of writing, and the two error directions are not symmetric --
    telling people the automation is safe when it is not costs a silent
    overnight wipe, while staying cautious costs a stale sentence. Morgan's
    call, 2026-09-06: record that the pin works, keep the manual remedy,
    and revisit once the fix has survived real sync cycles. So this is now
    a "not yet", not a "cannot" -- do not read it as the latter and do not
    quietly flip it either; that flip is a decision, and it has an owner.

    Reached a real consumer on 2026-09-06. A refresh took the engine to a
    commit whose `precedent_resolve.py` cites `source-naming` three times,
    while `process/upstream/` still sat 5 commits back and had no
    `practices/source-naming.md` -- so the repo's own `code-cites-practice`
    check reported three violations for a slug that does exist upstream, in
    code the consumer is not allowed to edit. Nothing in the refresh had
    said the two halves were now different ages.

    Reports, never fails: the skew is legitimate between an engine refresh
    and the catalogue update that follows it, and this runs at the moment
    the person is right there to act on it. Practice fail-gracefully: keep
    going, and tell the human.

    WHY HERE (asked for by Morgan, 2026-09-09). An update to the vendored
    engine is the one moment somebody is deliberately looking at how a repo
    gets its practices -- and it is also when a new engine file arrives that
    the environment may not be configured for. A credential that was never
    set produces no error at any other time: the sources simply are not
    there, and a session reads the universal catalogue believing it has
    them all. See tools/precedent_source_credentials.py for what that costs
    and what was measured about the fix.

    Never gates. A vendor update is not the place to refuse work over an

    record_ci_workflow_files() needs.

    THE GAP THIS CLOSES. record_ci_workflow_files() already does the right
    thing -- record what's on disk now, touch no content -- but before this
    it was reachable only from inside precedent_install.py/precedent_
    bootstrap_source.py at initial install, or by importing the module and
    calling it directly (which is what fixing two real consumer repos'
    stale post-hand-fix hashes took, 2026-09-19, since neither repo's
    session could run a full `refresh` against a live BestPractice clone
    mid-incident without either leaving the hash stale -- refused by the
    next refresh -- or accepting `refresh --force`
    overwriting the hand-authored fix with the generic template). A session
    in that position needs a supported way to say "this content is correct
    now, just re-baseline" without a clone and without risking an overwrite;
    this is that command.
