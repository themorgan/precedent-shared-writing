"""Vendors the minimal source-repo engine (this file, precedent_gate/paths/show.py, split_practices.py, a trimmed routing_scope.json) into an individual or shared set, and keeps it refreshable

precedent_vendor_engine.py — vendors Precedent's engine into a repo that
consumes it, as real tracked files instead of an undocumented hand-copy.
Two KINDS, sharing one mechanism:

  'source'   — an individual or shared practice SET (precedent-individual,
               precedent-team-repo-maintenance, precedent-team-tms). Needs
               ENGINE_FILES: enough to run its own AGENTS.md loader block
               (precedent_show.py's Rule/Detail/Why/Story/Install split,
               build_views.py's `--agents-only` regeneration,
               precedent_paths.py's path-trigger channel, precedent_gate.py's
               closed gate vocabulary), AND enough to resolve the person's
               own individual source, since a practice set is a repository
               somebody works in like any other (precedent_source_
               credentials.py, precedent_source_bootstrap.py). This is the
               original, narrower case this tool closed first — see
               spec/BOOTSTRAP_NEW_SOURCES.md.

  'consumer' — a real four-source CONSUMER repo (universal + team +
               individual + repo-local, a vendored process/upstream/, the
               full precedent_materialize.py/precedent_sync_views.py
               toolchain that resolves all of them into one materialized
               tree). Needs CONSUMER_ENGINE_FILES: everything 'source'
               needs, PLUS those materializing tools — see this repo's own
               engine-plus-host-shims practice ("domain-neutral mechanism
               lives in the vendored tree"). Piloted 2026-09-05 against
               a private consumer repo — INSTALL.md §1 step 12 and §2
               step 6 document the consumer-repo procedure this closes.

THE GAP 'source' CLOSED FIRST. tools/precedent_bootstrap_source.py has only
ever written practice content, config, approvers and the leak-blocklist —
never an engine file. Every individual/shared set that existed before this
tool got its tools/build_views.py, precedent_gate.py, precedent_paths.py,
precedent_show.py and split_practices.py into place by an undocumented,
one-off hand-copy, so none of them could tell a stale copy from a current
one, and precedent-team-tms's copy was simply missing outright.

THE GAP 'consumer' CLOSES. A real consumer's own tools/ needing the same
treatment was named explicitly as future work when 'source' shipped
(the TODO item that named it — since closed and removed — said: "not
piloted... deliberately not folded into the source-repo fix"). A private consumer repo — a real four-source
consumer, not a fixture — had the identical undocumented-hand-copy problem
'source' closed for practice sets: its top-level tools/ held
build_views.py, precedent_gate.py, precedent_paths.py, precedent_show.py,
split_practices.py, precedent_materialize.py, precedent_resolve.py and
precedent_sync_views.py, all copied in by hand at some point in the past
with no manifest, no recorded source commit, and (confirmed 2026-09-05) six
of those eight files had already drifted from BestPractice's current
tools/ — including the --repo-awareness fix (commit 7c8d33d) and the
repo-local `path: "."` safety fix (commit 29148bc's sibling changes to
precedent_resolve.py/precedent_materialize.py), silently missing from the
consumer's copy the whole time.

Distinct from tools/checkin.py, which mirrors a CONSUMER's whole
process/upstream/ tree, deleting anything the tree no longer has, in BOTH
directions (a consumer pulls upstream content AND pushes its own
check-ins back). This engine is one-directional in both kinds —
downstream from BestPractice only, since neither a source set nor a
consumer's own tools/ has engine code of its own to contribute back — and
it sits inside tools/ ALONGSIDE non-vendored, repo-owned files (tools/checks/,
routing_scope.json is vendored but trimmed, a source set's own
build_codeowners.py, a consumer's own light_check.py/
report_automation_issue.py -- and its tools/bootstrap.sh, which since
2026-09-25 is refreshed only while it carries no local edits; see
TEMPLATE_INSTANCES) that a whole-directory mirror-and-delete would
destroy. So this is a NEW, narrower tool, not an extension of checkin.py:
it touches only the files it knows about, by name, per kind.

ENGINE_FILES / CONSUMER_ENGINE_FILES both name this script itself last, on
purpose: it travels WITH the engine it defines, so a future improvement to
the vendoring mechanism itself reaches every already-vendored repo the same
way an improvement to build_views.py does — not a second, undocumented gap
one layer up from the one this tool closes. precedent_materialize.py and
precedent_sync_views.py are never in ENGINE_FILES (source) — a source set
has no process/upstream/ and materializes nothing — but they ARE in
CONSUMER_ENGINE_FILES, where resolving four sources into one materialized
tree is the entire point.

precedent_resolve.py WAS in that consumer-only group until 2026-09-13, on
the reasoning that a source set has "nothing to resolve against more than
one tree". That half was wrong, and it cost a measured failure: a set
resolves nothing, so its generated occasion index carried its own entries
and not one of universal's 94, and a session rooted there worked with every
universal rule silently absent. A set has exactly one other tree to resolve
against — universal's — and resolving it is how those rules reach the
session. So precedent_resolve.py and precedent_session_practices.py are now
in ENGINE_FILES, and the set reads universal out of an UNTRACKED
.precedent/SESSION_PRACTICES.md rather than a committed copy
(spec/SOURCE_SET_PROSE_GAP.md, shape 3, approved 2026-09-13).

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY IN NEITHER LIST: verify_harness.py, and only it. It is
this repo's own harness for this repo's own engine; a consumer has nothing
for it to verify.

THIS PARAGRAPH USED TO NAME leak_gate.py AND very_deep_check.py TOO, and
that stopped being true on 2026-09-20/21 -- both are vendored now, in
ENGINE_FILES above. The old reasoning was that they "run only from a
BestPractice checkout, against whatever repositories that session can
see", so improving them reached every repo for free. That was accurate
while nobody could run them anywhere else, and it is exactly what made
them unreachable in a consuming repo: a leak gate that only upstream can
run does not guard a downstream tree, and a "Very deep check" a person
says in their own project cannot be carried out.

It is kept here rather than deleted because the incident it records still
teaches: on 2026-09-07 a change to those two tools was written up as
needing a per-set engine refresh, and an item was opened saying the sets
were running stale copies -- of files they had never held. The reasoning
came from cross-source-rollout, a real practice that simply did not apply.
Nobody checked these lists first. CHECK THEM BEFORE COSTING A ROLLOUT, and
note that the answer changed: a claim about this file's contents made from
memory is now wrong in both directions.

routing_scope.json is vendored in both kinds too, but it is not a
byte-identical copy: precedent_gate.py's SCOPE file carries two things in
this repo — the closed GATE vocabulary (`gates`, the moments a practice can
fire at, which is the same everywhere Precedent's loader runs, regardless
of kind) and a `practices` key documenting the routing reason for every one
of BestPractice's OWN 60-odd practices, which has no meaning in either a
source set or a consumer repo with a different catalogue entirely.
`_trim_routing_scope` below keeps only the first and drops the second — the
same trim a prior, undocumented hand-copy already applied by hand to every
repo that needed it (precedent-individual, precedent-shared-repo-maintenance, and
and a private consumer repo's own top-level tools/routing_scope.json, all three
confirmed byte-identical to this function's output before this tool
existed, or was extended to the consumer kind); this tool just makes that
trim mechanical instead of a fact only the session that did it once
remembered.

SINCE 2026-09-15, the .claude/hooks/*.sh adapter scripts travel with the
engine too -- seed/status/refresh all cover them alongside tools/, tracked
in the same ENGINE_MANIFEST.json (see the HOOK_SOURCE_DIR block below for
why they are a second, smaller mechanism rather than folded into
ENGINE_FILES). Before this date they were installed once by
precedent_install.py and never refreshed, so a fix landing in a hook script
-- the freshness-guard.sh shallow-clone false-positive, record/GOTCHAS.md#g12,
is the incident that prompted this -- never reached an already-vendored
repo no matter how many times it ran `refresh`. .claude/settings.json itself
is still never touched by this tool, on purpose; see that block.

Five subcommands:

  seed <dest-dir> [--kind source|consumer]
                                  Run from BESTPRACTICE'S OWN checkout (the
                                  case tools/precedent_bootstrap_source.py
                                  needs — no clone required, the source IS
                                  this checkout). --kind defaults to
                                  'source' (unchanged CLI/API for every
                                  existing caller — precedent_bootstrap_
                                  source.py calls seed(dest) with no kind
                                  argument at all, and gets the same
                                  narrower set it always has). Copies the
                                  kind's file list and a trimmed
                                  routing_scope.json into <dest-dir>/tools/,
                                  and writes
                                  <dest-dir>/tools/ENGINE_MANIFEST.json
                                  recording this checkout's HEAD commit,
                                  the kind, and a sha256 per vendored file.

  status <bestpractice-clone>    Run from an ALREADY-VENDORED repo of
                                  either kind (same shape checkin.py's
                                  verbs use): reads `kind` back out of
                                  ENGINE_MANIFEST.json (no --kind flag
                                  needed — the manifest already says which
                                  file list applies) and compares the
                                  vendored files against its recorded
                                  hashes (local hand-edit?) and against the
                                  clone's current tools/ (upstream moved?).
                                  Exit 1 if either differs.

  refresh <bestpractice-clone> [--force] [--from-ref REF]
                                  Same kind auto-detection as status. Pulls
                                  the clone's SOURCE_BRANCH (see below —
                                  NOT the clone's configured default
                                  branch), refuses if a vendored file was
                                  hand-edited since the last seed/refresh
                                  (its sha256 no longer matches
                                  ENGINE_MANIFEST.json) unless --force, then
                                  re-copies + re-trims (the kind's own file
                                  list) and updates the manifest. Also keeps
                                  any file this repo's precedent.json maps
                                  under `engine_paths` (upstream path ->
                                  local path) current; see ENGINE_PATHS_KEY.

                                  needed: one `git ls-remote` of

                                  compared to the recorded commit. Always

                                  on network failure vs. loud on a fast,
                                  clean failure (checkin.py's fresh() carries
                                  the same distinction and the same reason:
                                  an unreachable remote must never read as
                                  "confirmed fresh").

  drop-retired [REPO] [--dry-run] [--offline]
                                 Clone-free. Drop from REPO's precedent.json
                                  every shared or individual set that says
                                  it is retired (`"retired"` in its own
                                  precedent-source.json) or that GitHub
                                  reports archived -- but only when every
                                  active rule it holds is in force in
                                  another declared source; otherwise it is
                                  kept and the rule is named. "Not Found"
                                  is reported, never acted on. Update
                                  Vendors runs this on its own.

Run (from an already-vendored repo's own checkout, either kind):
  python3 tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py fresh
  python3 tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py status  ../BestPractice
  python3 tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py refresh ../BestPractice
  python3 tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py record-ci
  python3 tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py drop-retired .

Run once, from BestPractice's own checkout, to vendor a NEW consumer repo
(status/refresh above then work unchanged, kind auto-detected):
  python3 tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py seed <consumer-repo> --kind consumer

seed copies this checkout's HEAD, and refuses a HEAD that main does not
contain: such an engine is one main has never had, and no refresh brings
it current until that work lands. --off-main does it on purpose, and the
manifest then names the real branch as seeded_from_branch (2026-10-02).

SOURCE_BRANCH is 'main', for every install at once, since 2026-09-25 --
the branch whose content has passed every local check AND the GitHub test
on the pull request into it (spec/BRANCH_TIERS_PLAN.md, "Installs take
their updates from main"). Morgan, 2026-09-25, after the first merge of staging into main: "Yes, switch all installs to main. ... Let's do it, go ahead, go update" (strength: decided). An install pinned to staging (or to
precedent-beta-v01, its name until that morning) takes this update from
main and is repointed there in the same update, per runbook step 1.

The history, because it was tried once before: on 2026-09-24 this read
'main' for a few hours on an approval Morgan later called assent rather
than a decision ("That was more an assent, than a decision. I didn't think
about it."), which left the installs split across two branches, and it went
back to precedent-beta-v01 ("for now, they should all follow
precedent-beta-v01"; "maybe later we'll move them all to follow main").
This is that later move, decided, and for every install at once.

# --- Hook files: the .claude/hooks/*.sh adapter scripts --------------------
# Distinct from ENGINE_FILES above in two ways: they live in a different
# source directory (templates/harness/claude-code/hooks/, not tools/) and a
# different destination (.claude/hooks/, not tools/). Until now they were
# installed once by precedent_install.py's _harness() and never refreshed --
# "Update Vendors" refreshed tools/ and the catalogue and silently left the
# hook scripts wherever initial install had put them. That is the same gap
# ENGINE_FILES closed for tools/precedent_reply_check.py and
# tools/precedent_close_detect.py (see this file's docstring above): a fix
# that lands upstream and never reaches an already-vendored repo because
# nothing carries it there. The freshness-guard.sh shallow-clone false-
# positive (record/GOTCHAS.md#g12) is the concrete incident this closes --
# every consumer that vendored before that fix landed would otherwise keep
# hitting it, forever, no matter how many times it ran "Update Vendors".
#
# Deliberately NOT folded into ENGINE_FILES/KINDS: that machinery assumes one
# shared source dir and one shared dest dir (both `tools/`). Reusing it here
# would mean smuggling a relative `../` path into a manifest key to reach
# outside tools/ -- workable, but a trap for the next reader who assumes
# every name in `files` resolves inside tools/. A second, smaller, explicitly
# separate mechanism is the honest shape, tracked in the SAME
# ENGINE_MANIFEST.json under its own `hook_files`/`hooks_sha256` keys so
# there is still one provenance record per repo, not two.
#
# HOW A HOOK LEAVES A CONSUMER (corrected 2026-09-24; this passage used to
# say no removal existed, which stopped being true on 2026-09-21). A hook
# the previous manifest recorded and upstream no longer ships, or one named
# in RETIRED_HOOK_FILES, is deleted by _remove_dropped_hook_files when its
# hash still matches. An UNTRACKED copy of a RETIRED_HOOK_FILES name --
# vendored before `hook_files` existed -- is deleted by
# retire_legacy_leftovers when its content matches the recogniser and
# nothing in .claude/settings.json still calls it. A hook upstream never
# shipped at all is the repo's own and nothing here touches it.
#
# .claude/settings.json is never OVERWRITTEN here.
# precedent_install.py's _harness() already leaves it alone once it exists,
# on purpose -- a consumer may have wired its own extra hooks alongside the
# vendored ones -- and a routine refresh has no business replacing a repo's
# own hook wiring. What a refresh DOES do, since 2026-09-25, is ADD the
# entry for a hook HOOK_WIRING says this repo's kind gets and that the repo
# neither wires nor declined -- see HOOK_WIRING below. It adds; it never
# edits or removes an entry that is already there.
HOOK_SOURCE_DIR = 'templates/harness/claude-code/hooks'
HOOK_DEST_DIR = '.claude/hooks'

# WHICH HOOKS EACH KIND OF REPO GETS -- declared, never inferred from what a
# repo happens to wire already (Morgan, 2026-09-25, strength: decided: "I
# like the lists of 'repos that [are of this type] get [these hooks]' --
# approved"). Keyed by KIND, never by repository: a repo nobody has ever
# heard of gets its kind's list, exactly like a repo on every list we keep.
#
# THE BUG THIS CLOSES (todo-2026-09-21-a-new-hook-cannot-reach-an-installed-
# consumer.md). Vendoring used to be gated on the repo's own settings.json
# alone, and a refresh never wrote that file -- so a hook added upstream
# could not reach a repo that was already installed. It was not vendored
# until it was wired, and wiring it meant naming a file that was not there
# yet. The engine read "not wired" as "declined", when for a new hook it
# only ever means "not yet". doc-lint-gate.sh made that a correctness bug:
# Markdown lint left CI on 2026-09-21 because the hook replaced it, so a
# repo that took the update and never got the hook lost lint entirely.
#
# HOW IT IS APPLIED (_hook_wiring_plan, _apply_hook_wiring). For each entry
# here, on each refresh: if the repo already runs that hook at that event
# (from ANY path -- a set that calls a script in place from its own
# bootstrap/ is already wired), or declared it in precedent.json's
# `declined_adapters`, nothing happens. Otherwise the entry is ADDED to
# .claude/settings.json, and the ordinary vendoring below -- still gated on
# wiring -- then delivers the file on the same run. Adding the entry first
# is what keeps the gate's own guarantee: no file is ever planted that
# nothing calls (hooks-on-disk-are-reachable).
#
# The two reasons the wiring gate existed both still hold, and this list is
# how each is kept rather than broken:
#   1. a source set and a consumer run different subsets of the one shared
#      hooks/ directory -- so each kind has its own list;
#   2. a repo that declined a hook stays declined -- by declaring it in
#      `declined_adapters` with a reason, never by leaving it unwired and
#      hoping the engine guesses.
#
# Each entry: (event, matcher or None, hook file, arguments). `{base}` in
# the arguments is the repo's base branch, read off the freshness-guard
# entries it already has; where there are none the entry is reported and
# left for a person, never guessed. A manifest with no `kind` (vendored
# before kinds existed) gets NO list applied: guessing a kind is how a
# consumer would receive a set's hooks.
#
# ADDING A HOOK (practice: new-hook-joins-the-registry). A new *.sh in
# HOOK_SOURCE_DIR goes on a kind's list here AND into that kind's template
# -- templates/harness/claude-code/settings.json for a consumer,
# precedent_bootstrap_source.py's settings payload for a set -- or into
# HOOKS_NO_KIND with the reason no kind gets it. precedent_check.py's
# `new-hook-joins-the-registry` refuses a tree where any of those disagree.

    WHY (2026-09-26). The refresh wires hooks into a source clone's
    .claude/settings.json and, like everything else it writes there, never
    commits the result. precedent_refresh_sources.classify_dirt did not
    count that file as engine output, so precedent_container_safe.py called
    every refreshed clone "uncommitted changes" and the archive gate said
    "Don't archive this session" on every reply, over an edit the next
    session's refresh makes again anyway. Morgan, the same day: if it is
    regenerated at every session start, why is it a reason not to archive?

    The file is also a person's, so it cannot simply join the owned set: a
    hand edit there is exactly what the scanner exists to protect. This
    answers the narrower question instead -- is the difference exactly what
    the refresh would have written? -- by the shape _apply_hook_wiring
    produces and nothing looser: every key but `hooks` unchanged; every
    group already there unchanged except for entries appended to the end of

    THE INCIDENT (2026-09-21,
    todo-2026-09-21-refresh-deletes-a-workflow-another-file-depends-on.md).
    A refresh deleted `.github/workflows/precedent-check.yml` from four
    practice sets. A second workflow in each of them had been PAUSED hours
    earlier, its own header saying in as many words that its checks "now run
    as steps in .github/workflows/precedent-check.yml's single job". The
    fold's destination was gone; the pause's premise was true when it was
    written and false the same afternoon; two commit-scope checks ran
    nowhere, and nothing said a word.

    precedent_decommission.py already refuses to retire a file other files
    still name -- WITHIN one repository, when a person runs it deliberately.
    Deletion travels through refresh() to every installed repo; the
    dependency question never travelled with it. This is that question,
    asked at the moment of deletion.

    IT REPORTS AND NEVER REFUSES. A document that mentions a retired file by
    name is usually correct to (a story about a decommissioning names what
    was decommissioned), so refusing a refresh over a mention would block
    routine updates on prose. What the refresh owes is that nobody finds out

    THE GAP THIS CLOSES. `refresh` only ever added and overwrote. Rename or

    updates it, and nobody can tell whether it still does something. That is
    exactly the state `decommission-deletes-files` exists to prevent,
    produced by the tool that distributes that practice.

    Found 2026-09-07 while costing the retirement->decommission rename:
    `precedent_decommission.py` is in the consumer engine set, so renaming it
    would have pushed the new name into every consumer and left the old one
    beside it, in perpetuity, in two repos today and every future one.

    WHY THIS IS SAFE, and it rests entirely on the manifest. The only files
    considered are ones the PREVIOUS manifest recorded as vendored here --
    written by this tool, into a directory the consuming repo also keeps its
    own files in. A file the engine never wrote is never a candidate, so a
    repo's own tools/ cannot be touched no matter what it is named.

    A hand-edited file is kept and reported, never deleted. `_local_drift`
    already refuses the whole refresh over one unless --force is passed, so
    reaching here with a modified file means somebody asked to overwrite --
    which is not the same as asking to throw the edit away. Recovering a

    deletion-propagation table, `very-deep-check` pass 2 item 8b; filed as
    todo-2026-09-21-a-dropped-hook-never-leaves-a-consumer.md). Until now
    this engine had exactly two removal paths -- _remove_dropped_engine_
    files for tools/ and _remove_retired_ci_workflow_files for
    .github/workflows/ -- and none for .claude/hooks/. A hook dropped
    upstream stayed installed in every consumer, and _write_hook_files then
    REPLACED `hook_files` with only what it had just written, so the
    manifest entry vanished too: the file went on running, every session,
    recorded by nothing and visible to no check keyed on the manifest.

    That is the CI-workflow asymmetry one directory over, and a hook is the
    worse of the two -- a stale workflow burns a runner minute, a stale hook
    executes in every session of every repo that still carries it.

    WHAT COUNTS AS DROPPED, precisely: a name the PREVIOUS manifest recorded
    that upstream no longer SHIPS. Not "no longer wired here" -- un-wiring
    is the repo's own act and hooks-on-disk-are-reachable already reports
    the orphan it leaves -- and not "claimed by an adapter", which is
    another mechanism maintaining the same path on purpose.

    THE GUARD THIS NEEDS AND THE ENGINE PATH DOES NOT. `available` comes
    from a directory glob, and _hook_file_names returns [] for a directory
    that is not there. An empty upstream hooks/ is indistinguishable from
    "this checkout cannot see upstream", and sweeping on that reading would
    delete every hook in the consumer. So an empty `available` sweeps
    NOTHING, the same refusal _remove_retired_ci_workflow_files makes for an
    unrecognised kind.

# --- Declared engine paths: an upstream file kept at a path of the repo's own
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-09-24). precedent-individual keeps
# `bootstrap/commit-identity.sh` byte-identical to this repo's
# templates/harness/claude-code/hooks/commit-identity.sh, and until now only
# by hand: four sync commits in ten days, each one a session noticing the
# drift. The hooks block above cannot help -- it vendors into .claude/hooks/
# only, and a repo that wires a script from its own path is deliberately
# skipped (_wired_hook_names_anywhere). Moving the file is not an option
# either: this repo's own .claude/hooks/session-start.sh runs
# `<individual set>/bootstrap/commit-identity.sh` by that exact path, and the
# set's precedent.json `adapters` ships it to consumers FROM there, so the
# path is load-bearing in two places and deleting it fails silently in both.
#
# So the repo DECLARES the mapping, in its own precedent.json:
#
#     "engine_paths": {
#       "templates/harness/claude-code/hooks/commit-identity.sh":
#         "bootstrap/commit-identity.sh"
#     }
#
# upstream path (in this repo's tree) -> local path (in the declaring repo).
# `refresh` then copies it like any engine file, records its sha256 in
# ENGINE_MANIFEST.json (`engine_paths`/`engine_paths_sha256`), and a
# hand-edit is drift, refused without --force, exactly as for tools/.
#
# Four rules, each closing a way this could hurt:
#
#   * NO SECOND WRITER. A local path an adapter already writes (an adapter's
#     TO, per _adapter_claimed_paths) or one this engine already vendors is
#     refused, whatever --force says: two mechanisms owning one file is the
#     double-maintenance that reads as a hand-edit later. An adapter's FROM
#     is fine -- that is precedent-individual's case, and consumers are
#     unaffected because the adapter still copies from the same place.
#   * FIRST RUN ADOPTS, NEVER OVERWRITES. With no hash recorded yet, a local
#     file identical to upstream is adopted silently; a different one is
#     refused with a count of differing lines, EVEN UNDER --force. --force
#     means "discard the edit I was told about"; on a first run nobody has
#     been told anything yet. It also has to hold under refresh's own second
#     pass, which re-runs with --force whenever the tool replaced itself --
#     which is exactly the run that first acts on a new declaration.
#   * AN UPSTREAM FILE THAT VANISHED IS KEPT. Warned about, loudly, on every
#     refresh that reaches the write step; the local copy and its record
#     stay. Deleting a repo's own-path file on a routine refresh is a larger
#     decision than this makes.
#   * A DROPPED DECLARATION HANDS THE FILE BACK. It stops being tracked and
#     becomes the repo's own, left on disk and said once.

# --- CI workflow files: templates/github-actions/*.template ----------------
# Distinct from the tools/ engine files and the .claude/hooks/ scripts above
# in the same two ways HOOK_SOURCE_DIR's own comment names for itself: a
# different source directory (templates/github-actions/, not tools/) and a
# different destination (.github/workflows/, not tools/ or .claude/hooks/).
# Until 2026-09-18 these files were installed ONCE -- precedent_install.py's
# _bootstrap_and_ci and precedent_bootstrap_source.py's _install_workflows
# both write `if not wf.exists() or force`, never on an ordinary refresh --
# so "Update Vendors" never re-copied the template body into an
# already-installed file. Reached a real consumer this way: doc-lint.yml.
# template's `concurrency:` block (2026-09-15) reached an already-installed
# bestpractice-docs.yml only when that repo reinstalled from scratch, and
# spec/CI_MINUTES_PLAN.md's Phase C debounce-guard step (added the next day)
# never reached it at all -- the same class of gap the hooks block above
# closed for .claude/hooks/*.sh on 2026-09-15.
#
# KIND-SPECIFIC, unlike the hooks above (which vendor the SAME scripts into
# both kinds, narrowed only by what a repo's own settings.json wires). A
# consumer installs leak-gate.yml and light-check.yml; a source set installs
# none (2026-09-21: a practice set runs no CI; its own workflow template was
# retired on 2026-10-01) --
# CI_WORKFLOW_TEMPLATES is the one place that pairing is declared, so
# precedent_bootstrap_source.py's own WORKFLOW_TEMPLATES reuses it rather
# than repeating it (practice: registry-source-of-truth).
#
# Both are gated on `ci_workflows` at the point they are WRITTEN
# (precedent_install.py's / precedent_bootstrap_source.py's own
# `_ci_preference`) -- nothing below this line asks that question again. A
# file this kind's list names but that is not present on disk is simply not
# this mechanism's business: correctly absent because CI is declined, same
# as always.
#
# THE CATCH-UP IS DELIBERATELY DIFFERENT FROM THE HOOKS ONE ABOVE. A hook
# script is engine code this repo ships as an unmodified adapter -- "this
# engine has no local variance by design" -- so the hooks catch-up
# overwrites an untracked one outright. A CI workflow YAML is exactly the
# kind of file a real repo hand-tunes (an extra job, a changed schedule, a
# repo-specific secret), so the first refresh after this shipped must not
# silently discard that. `_refresh_ci_workflow_files` below records a
# baseline hash for an untracked file and leaves its content alone; only a
# LATER refresh, once that baseline exists, can tell "matches what we
# recorded" from "hand-edited" and act on it.
CI_WORKFLOWS_SOURCE_DIR = 'templates/github-actions'
# A CONSUMER'S CI CONVERGES TO UPSTREAM, AND NOBODY IS ASKED (2026-09-27).
# Since the branch-tier change (spec/BRANCH_TIERS_PLAN.md) the checks run
# locally -- the basic tier on a working branch, the full check on staging
# and main -- and a consumer's one GitHub run is upstream's light check, on a
# pull request into main. Any other workflow in a consumer, or a hand-edited
# copy of that one, is what the change exists to stop, so a refresh in a kind
# named here does not treat it as a decision to protect:
#
#   - every file CI_WORKFLOW_TEMPLATES ships to the kind is written from the
#     current template over whatever is there, tracked or not, edited or not
#     (_refresh_ci_workflow_files), and a hand edit is no longer a refusal
#     (_ci_workflow_drift);
#   - every other workflow is removed, unless the person approved it in
#     their own words in precedent.json's github_ci_approved
#     (_remove_unapproved_workflows). A local_ci_workflows declaration no
#     longer keeps one in a consumer: only the person's approval does.
#
# NOTHING NEEDED IS LOST (Morgan, 2026-09-27: "it should do a check first to
# make sure nothing needed is being lost"). Before a file is replaced or
# removed, _would_lose lists what it runs -- scripts, test runners,
# third-party actions -- that neither the local push check nor the replacing
# template runs. If anything is on that list the file is held back, LOUDLY:
# a banner at the end of the refresh and of Update Vendors, a "Left for you"
# line, and an open item in the repo's todo/ (_held_back). Morgan, the same
# day (strength: decided): "leave it alone, but flag it importantly ...
# strong language ... make it a to-do so that it's noted".
#
# Each is reported as done. Morgan, 2026-09-27 (strength: decided, relayed
# verbatim by the session that hit it): "It should definitely definitely use
# the newer version from upstream ... the point of the yml changes is to stop
# these extra needless (often hand edited) yml files from running, that's why
# we now run the checks locally etc so it shouldn't ask. Asking creates doubt
# and confusion when there isn't any."
#
# THE 2026-09-20 SWEEP, and why this is not a repeat of it. That sweep
# deleted nine live checks on a guess from their filenames, and the checks
# were lost. Two things differ now. The checks a consumer relies on run in
# the local push check, so the GitHub copy is a second run of work the push
# gate already did; where a repository's own command is NOT in its local
# gate, the fix is to run it there, not to keep a workflow billing minutes
# for it. And nothing is destroyed: only a file git tracks with no
# uncommitted edits is replaced or removed, so its content stays in history,
# and the report names every script it ran.
#
# A PRACTICE SOURCE CONVERGES TOO, since 2026-10-01, on the same terms as a
# consumer: it ships no workflow (CI_WORKFLOW_TEMPLATES['source'] is empty),
# so every workflow it still carries goes, unless removing it would stop
# something running that nothing local runs. ONLY THEN IS THE PERSON ASKED
# (Morgan, 2026-10-01: "Ask if genuinely in doubt"): the session says in
# plain words what the file does and what would stop, recommends, and asks
# keep or delete. A keep is recorded as their approval in
# github_ci_approved, which keeps it in either kind; nothing that loses
# nothing is ever asked about (2026-09-27: "Asking creates doubt and
# confusion when there isn't any"). Until then a
# set "ran its own on purpose", and a leftover there was never cleared:
# Morgan, 2026-10-01, on finding one still in a set: make sure "in future
# updates this is solved beforehand in the update, not just this file but
# others".

    # MEASURED, from his own GitHub usage export for that day. 127 of 143
    # billed minutes -- 89% -- came from four practice sets running these

    # light-check, cost 16 minutes between them. The sets' share had gone
    # 2% -> 89% in eleven days while the absolute number stayed flat,

    # each push fires both workflows in each.
    #
    # WHY A SOURCE IS THE RIGHT PLACE TO STOP. Every change to a set
    # arrives through a session that runs the full gate suite before it
    # pushes -- the deep check is what gates a push (two-check-levels), and
    # the commit gate already ran doc_lint. CI there re-checks a tree that
    # was checked seconds earlier by the same tools. And most of what it
    # runs does not apply: a set carries few of the practices the registry
    # binds, so precedent-check SKIPS most of its catalogue there, which is
    # how two real sets came to report `0 passed` on an ordinary commit.
    # We were paying per-job minutes, rounded up, for a second opinion that
    # was mostly skips.
    #
    # A CONSUMER IS DIFFERENT and keeps its leak gate. A consuming repo can
    # receive a contribution from a fork, whose pushes never fire `push` in
    # the receiving repository -- so without the workflow a contributed
    # branch reaches it unscanned. A source set is single-owner and takes
    # no forks.

    # _remove_retired_ci_workflow_files sweeps whatever a kind no longer

    # while an unknown kind still triggers nothing.

#
# THE GAP THIS CLOSES, found 2026-09-19 in a real individual practice set.
# views-drift.yml.template was folded into the practice-set workflow
# template (itself retired 2026-10-01) as its own job (spec/CI_MINUTES_PLAN.md item 9), and the four repos that hand-
# applied that fix the same day deleted the now-redundant views-drift.yml
# file -- but nothing told refresh() the old entry was retired, so
# ci_workflows_sha256 kept recording a hash for a file that no longer
# existed. _ci_workflow_drift reads "recorded, but missing on disk" as a
# hand-edit needing --force, so the NEXT refresh() in that repo would have
# refused entirely over a file the fix had already, correctly, removed --
# not the file-content drift that check exists to catch.
#
# WHY A TOMBSTONE, MIRRORING RETIRED_ENGINE_FILES, RATHER THAN JUST DIFFING
# CI_WORKFLOW_TEMPLATES. A name gone from the current mapping is ambiguous
# on its own: it could mean "retired, fold its job into the survivor" (safe
# to stop tracking) or "a repo's own tools/ vendored an older engine that
# still lists a file dropped since" (nothing to clean up, this repo simply
# has not refreshed yet). Naming the retirement explicitly, with the reason,
# is what makes automatic cleanup safe to do unconditionally rather than
# guessing from absence.
#
# WHY THIS DELETES THE FILE WHEN IT IS SAFE TO, as of 2026-09-20 --
# mirroring _remove_dropped_engine_files for an ordinary tools/*.py engine
# file, not this mechanism's original "never deletes" design. refresh()'s
# own comment on ci_incomplete still holds the reason a retired workflow
# file is never deleted UNCONDITIONALLY: "deleting somebody's
# .github/workflows/*.yml out from under them on a routine refresh is a
# different, larger decision than this fix makes." What changed is that
# _remove_retired_ci_workflow_files (below) now only ever deletes a copy
# whose on-disk content still matches the hash the manifest last recorded
# for it -- the untouched, stock retired template, and nothing else. A
# hand-edited copy, or one the manifest never recorded a hash for, is kept
# and reported exactly as before; only the manifest's stale tracking entry
# is ever dropped unconditionally. Raised by Morgan
# ("shouldn't we delete the files? ... it creates confusion and complexity
# and risk and cost") against a live incident: a fresh usage-report pull
# found several personal repos still billing real minutes against files
# this mechanism already knew were retired. This closes the half of that
# gap this mechanism can reach going forward -- a FUTURE rename/fold, the
# same way views-drift.yml's own retirement was. It does NOT retroactively
# clean up a file that predates this tombstone system entirely (nothing
# ever recorded a hash for it to compare against) -- see
# spec/CI_MINUTES_PLAN.md's Phase B sweep for that half.

    WHY THIS EXISTS, and why the two escapes that already existed are not

    vendored workflow -- 2026-09-21's case was an identity fold plus a
    deliberate note about a flag the repo does not want. `refresh` refuses,
    correctly, because it cannot tell that edit from an accident. But both
    routes out DESTROY the divergence: `--force` overwrites it on the spot,
    and `record-ci` re-baselines the hash so the NEXT refresh overwrites it
    silently, which is worse. The session that hit it swapped the template
    in, ran the refresh, and put the file back by hand -- a manoeuvre that
    works exactly once and leaves nothing behind for the next person, who
    will meet the same wall with no hint that anyone has been here.

    A REASON IS REQUIRED, not optional. A bare list would be an opt-out
    nobody has to justify, which is how an exemption stops being read; an
    entry with an empty reason is ignored, exactly as if it were absent,
    and refresh says so rather than honouring it silently.

    had recorded for it under ci_workflows_sha256.

    WHAT "MATCHES THE RECORDED HASH" DOES AND DOES NOT PROVE. The recorded
    hash is whatever this engine itself last wrote for this path -- from the
    original record_ci_workflow_files() call at install/refresh time, or a
    later hand-triggered `record-ci` re-baseline. A match proves the file
    has not changed since the manifest last looked, which is everything
    _ci_workflow_drift() means by "not drifted" elsewhere in this module --
    the SAME standard, not a weaker one invented for this function. It does
    NOT prove the file was never hand-edited at any point in its history:
    someone could have edited it and then run `record-ci` to accept that
    edit as correct (exactly what that subcommand exists for), which
    updates the recorded hash to match the edit. If that same file's
    workflow is later retired, this function reads it as "matches the
    recorded hash" and deletes it -- a real, known gap, not a hypothetical
    one: see spec/CI_WORKFLOW_RETIREMENT_PLAN.md's "Touched, precisely"
    section for the full tradeoff and why it was left open rather than
    closed here.

    A path this function never even considers: one ci_workflows_sha256 has
    no entry for at all (this kind never vendored it, ci_workflows was
    disabled, or the file predates this tracking system entirely, like the
    pre-2026-09-14 legacy templates spec/CI_MINUTES_PLAN.md's Phase B still
    has to sweep by hand). `dropped` below is built only from paths that ARE
    manifest keys, so an untracked file is structurally invisible here --
    this function can delete a file it was already watching, never one it
    was not.

    Idempotent and safe to call unconditionally: a manifest with no such
    entry writes nothing and returns []. Called at the very top of refresh(),
    before _ci_workflow_drift ever runs, so a retirement this old cannot
    cause the "missing" drift RETIRED_CI_WORKFLOW_FILES exists to defuse --
    see that dict's own comment for the incident.

    #
    # 1. A RETIRED_CI_WORKFLOW_FILES tombstone -- an explicit, reasoned
    #    entry, which is the only way a RENAME can be expressed.
    # 2. THIS KIND NO LONGER SHIPS IT. Until today this function read the
    #    tombstone dict alone, and _remove_dropped_engine_files -- the
    #    ordinary tools/ path, six hundred lines up -- has always done the
    #    opposite: it diffs the PREVIOUS manifest against what the kind
    #    includes now, so dropping a name propagates its deletion whether
    #    or not anybody remembered a tombstone.
    #
    #    That asymmetry was the concrete hole. Dropping a template from
    #    CI_WORKFLOW_TEMPLATES without also writing a tombstone left the
    #    installed workflow in every repo, forever, tracked by a manifest
    #    entry nothing would ever clear. Found 2026-09-21 while answering
    #    "are deletions passed through to the vendored-in repos?" -- the
    #    answer was yes for engine files and no for CI workflows, and
    #    nobody had noticed the two paths disagreed.
    #
    # THE GUARD THE ENGINE PATH DOES NOT NEED. _remove_dropped_engine_files
    # is called with a `kind` its caller has already validated. Here the
    # kind comes out of the MANIFEST, which is a file on disk in somebody
    # else's repository -- and `CI_WORKFLOW_TEMPLATES.get(<unknown>, ())`

# --- Leftovers of the pre-Precedent install, recognised by CONTENT
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (Morgan, 2026-09-24, strength: decided): "this needs to be
# deleted from ALL installs, the migration to the new precedent should [have]
# deleted this." Measured the same day in six of his installs: the old
# install's workflows survived in five of them, a month after migration.
#
# WHY THE TWO REMOVERS ABOVE NEVER SAW THEM. _remove_retired_ci_workflow_files
# and _remove_dropped_hook_files only consider a path the manifest recorded,
# and only while its hash still matches. An install older than that tracking
# recorded nothing, and a hand-paused copy no longer matches, so both kinds
# were structurally invisible: `bestpractice-docs.yml` had been retired for
# three days and was still in all five installs that had it -- two tracked but
# hand-paused, three never tracked at all.
#
# WHY CONTENT AND NEVER THE NAME. Every copy of these files differs (four
# installs, four different `bestpractice-upstream-sync.yml`s), so no single
# hash can recognise them. And a name alone has already deleted live checks:
# the 2026-09-20 sweep trusted a filename and took out nine
# (spec/CI_MINUTES_PLAN.md item 14), `light-check.yml` among them, which is a
# LIVE check in most installs. So a path is deleted only when its content has
# the old install's structural shape, and a file with the name but not the
# shape is kept and reported for a person to read. `light-check.yml` is on no
# list here at all.
#
# WHAT IS REUSED RATHER THAN FORKED. precedent_decommission.py's refusals
# about the file itself (untracked, uncommitted edits, a live trigger) and its
# registry, process/decommissioned_paths.json. Its reference search is NOT
# applied as a refusal, the same call dependents_of() makes for every other
# refresh deletion: a consumer's materialized practices/ names every retired
# workflow by design, so that refusal would fire every time and delete
# nothing. The references are reported instead.

    kept)], where `kept` is True when the path was left as it was.

    The rename is fixed and known, so there is nothing to ask. Listing it
    for the person was not enough: a set's own precedent-source.json
    carries its new name, the resolver refuses a clone that answers to a
    different name than the one declared, and the view sync stopped a
    consumer's update on exactly that (2026-09-28: "calls itself
    precedent-shared-repo-maintenance ... declares it as
    precedent-team-repo-maintenance").

    The PATH moves only when that is safe right now: when something is
    already at the new path, or nothing is at the old one. A clone still
    sitting at the old path with nothing at the new is left where it is --
    repointing would make the set missing, and the sync refuses to write
    from an incomplete source set -- and the caller says so.

    A clone whose own precedent-source.json still answers to the old name
    (or to any name but the new one) is left entirely alone: names are the
    author's since 2026-09-18, so a set may still be called
    precedent-team-something on purpose, and renaming its declaration would
    cause the very refusal this exists to prevent. Like stale_source_paths,

## What

**`{rel}` was left alone by Update Vendors, and it still runs in GitHub.**
This repo's workflows converge to upstream: the ones upstream ships are
replaced with its templates, and every other one is removed. This one was
not {done}, because it runs {', '.join(lost)}, which the local push check
does not run. Taking it away would have stopped that running anywhere.

**Ask the person, once:** say in plain words what it does and what would
stop, give your recommendation, and ask whether to keep it or delete it.
**Keep:** record their own words in `precedent.json`'s `github_ci_approved`,
pinned by sha256 (practice: ci-workflow-approved), and no update asks again.
**Delete:** if what it runs is still wanted, run it locally -- in
`tools/light_check.py`, or as a test under `tools/checks/tests/` -- and the
next Update Vendors removes the file. Close this item when either is done.

## Story

Written by Update Vendors on {day}. Morgan, 2026-09-27: "If there is
something that is not covered, leave it alone, but flag it importantly ...
Also, make it a to-do so that it's noted." And 2026-10-01: "Ask if
genuinely in doubt."

    _write_hook_files, when it ran), whose own manifest write knows nothing

    one refresh() already keeps for _remove_dropped_engine_files -- and the

    Per file: not on disk (ci_workflows disabled, or genuinely absent) ->
    left alone. Not yet recorded -> baseline recorded, content UNTOUCHED

    template, hash updated. This one rule covers both an ordinary refresh
    (where, by the time this runs, an on-disk mismatch against the recorded
    hash can only mean --force accepted a hand-edit, since the upfront
    drift check already refused otherwise) and --force overwriting a
    hand-edited file outright, the same way --force already treats every
    other drifted file in this tool.

    IN A KIND WHOSE CI CONVERGES (CI_CONVERGES_KINDS) none of that caution

    not it was ever recorded, and any github_ci_approved entry for it is
    dropped, because the manifest now vouches for it. The one thing still
    refused is destroying content git does not hold (_unsafe_to_replace).

# --- Repo-owned files instantiated from a template: tools/bootstrap.sh -----
# The third mechanism of the same family as the hooks and CI workflows
# above, added 2026-09-25, and the only one of the three that NEVER
# overwrites a file carrying local edits, --force included.
#
# THE GAP. precedent_install.py copies templates/bootstrap.sh to a
# consumer's tools/bootstrap.sh once, verbatim, and until this block nothing
# ever looked at it again: this module's own docstring called it repo-owned,
# so refresh left it alone and nothing compared it to the template. Measured
# 2026-09-25 in a real consumer taking an update: its bootstrap.sh was the
# template minus the two blocks added around 2026-09-23 (the practice_audit
# `--loader-notice` call and `precedent_engine_freshness.py --quiet`), so
# the session-start freshness check that
# todo/todo-2026-09-21-nothing-checks-a-consumer-against-upstream.md
# describes as running "for every consumer" had never once run there. The
# fix that came in the same update only arrived because a session copied it
# by hand. Reproduced on a scratch consumer holding the pre-2026-09-23
# template: `refresh` said "already current -- nothing to do" and `status`
# said nothing at all.
#
# WHY IT NEVER OVERWRITES AN EDITED COPY, unlike the CI workflows. The
# template tells every repo to add entries to this file ("every entry here
# should exist because its absence cost a real session"), so local lines
# are the file working as designed, not drift to refuse or discard. An
# edited copy is reported DIVERGED, with the template blocks it lacks named
# by line, and the refresh carries on.
#
# WHAT COUNTS AS UNEDITED. Either the manifest recorded a hash for it and
# the file still matches, or -- the catch-up for every install that predates
# this block, which recorded nothing -- the file is byte-identical to SOME
# past version of the template in the upstream clone's history. Either way
# it is stock content nobody touched, so it is rewritten to the current
# template. Anything else is diverged. A shallow upstream clone can hide the
# matching past version; that errs toward DIVERGED, the side that loses
# nothing.

# Added 2026-09-28. A diverged tools/bootstrap.sh or AGENTS.md section went
# on the Left-for-you list on every refresh, and precedent_update.py exits 1
# while that list has anything on it -- so a repo that words a section its
# own way ON PURPOSE could never finish an update. Measured in three
# consumers the same day: one listed the same six sections across five
# updates with the template unchanged since; one listed nine every run after
# its session had recorded a `diverged` entry in process/manifest.json,
# which the runbook pointed at and nothing here ever read; one's
# bootstrap.sh was the template plus one pip package. A MISSING section was
# already remembered; a diverged one had no way to be.
#
# THE DECLARATION, in precedent.json, one entry per kept item, keyed by the
# item exactly as the report names it ("tools/bootstrap.sh", or "AGENTS.md"
# then a space then the section's heading line):
#
#     "kept_template_divergences": {
#       "tools/bootstrap.sh": {
#         "reason": "adds pyyaml; our scripts import it",
#         "template_sha256": "<printed by the refresh>"
#       }
#     }
#
# A REASON IS REQUIRED, for local_ci_workflows' reason: an entry without
# one is not honoured, and the refresh says so. THE HASH PINS THE DECISION
# to the template text it was made against -- the whole template file for
# bootstrap.sh, the instantiated section for AGENTS.md -- the way
# practice_audit.py pins a decline. While it matches, the item prints one
# line with its reason and stays off the list; once upstream changes that
# text, the decision no longer covers what is in force and the item is
# listed again in full, with the new hash to record if it is still kept.

# --- AGENTS.md's template-written sections ----------------------------------
# The same gap as TEMPLATE_INSTANCES above, one file over, closed the same
# way on 2026-09-25. precedent_install.py writes AGENTS.md from
# templates/AGENTS.md.loader.template once, and from then on the only part
# of it anything rewrites is the generated loader block, which
# precedent_sync_views.py owns. Every other section the template wrote --
# "### Session start", "### Two check levels", "## Git / workflow" and the
# rest -- was frozen at install, so no fix to the template ever reached an
# installed repo, and nothing said so. Measured the same day in a real
# consumer: the template's session-start bullet told a session to attach the
# individual practice set but not where its clone lives, the attach tool
# said /home/user/<name>, the session-start hook had already cloned it to
# ~/precedent-individual (the only copy anything reads), and within the
# hour the two copies had diverged. The consumer fixed its own copy by hand;
# no template fix could have reached it.
#
# THE UNIT IS A SECTION, NOT THE FILE. AGENTS.md is the one file every repo
# is told to fill in, so the file as a whole is always edited; comparing it
# whole would call every install diverged and deliver nothing. A section is
# a `##` or `###` heading and everything up to the next one (or the
# generated block's marker), keyed by the heading line. A template heading
# that is itself a placeholder (`## <Deliverable build workflow>`) is the
# repo's to name and is never tracked; its fixed-heading subsections are.
#
# WHAT HAPPENS TO EACH, per refresh -- never a local edit overwritten:
#   current  -- already the template's text (placeholders substituted the
#               way install substitutes them). Recorded.
#   refresh  -- matches the hash recorded for it, so nobody edited it, and
#               the template moved. Rewritten; the new text recorded.
#   adopt    -- nothing recorded (every install before this date), but
#               identical to the section in SOME past version of either
#               AGENTS.md template. Stock, so rewritten and recorded -- the
#               one-time catch-up.
#   diverged -- anything else. Left alone, --force included, and reported
#               with every block (bullet, paragraph, table row) of the
#               current template's section it lacks, down to the sentences
#               where it has part of one. On the Left-for-you list.
#   missing  -- the template has the section, this AGENTS.md does not, and
#               no refresh has seen that before. Reported and put on the
#               list, never written in: where it belongs in a file this
#               repo has rearranged is a judgment. Recorded as absent, so
#               the next refresh says it in one line rather than again in
#               full -- a section a repo chose not to have is a decision.
#               It is only a decision once the person has been asked, so a
#               self-replacing refresh hands this item to its second pass,

# --- A renamed branch, still named in a repo's own text --------------------
# 525e90a (2026-09-25) renamed precedent-beta-v01 to staging. The engine's
# own pin moved with the refresh that carried it; the text a repo wrote
# itself did not: a real consumer measured that day named the old branch on
# six lines of AGENTS.md and three of tools/bootstrap.sh, in links, in a
# `git clone --branch` line and in a session-start warning.
#
# TWO WAYS THAT TEXT COULD CATCH UP, and why this is the second. (1) Keep
# the old name as an alias until consumers catch up. It already is one --
# every Promote fast-forwards precedent-beta-v01 to staging -- and that is
# what keeps the stale lines working today. But an alias alone never tells
# anyone the text is stale, so "until consumers catch up" has no event to
# end on, and the alias has to live forever. (2) Report every mention, on
# every refresh and status. That is the half that actually reaches the
# text, and it gives the alias its retirement condition: it goes once no
# consumer's refresh reports one. So both, with the report as the
# mechanism and the alias as the bridge.
#
# What is left out: a line inside the generated block (the next sync
# rewrites it from the catalogue; a hand edit there is refused), and a line
# that also names the new branch, which is recording the rename rather than
# using the old name ("`staging` (named `precedent-beta-v01` until ...)").
#
# The generated block is only cleared by a sync if the catalogue itself is
# clean, and on 2026-09-26 it was not: a shared set's name-the-branch
# index_clause named precedent-beta-v01, so every sync wrote it back into
# the same consumer. precedent_check's retired-branch-name-ships reads this
# table and reports that text in the set that publishes it, which is the

def _warn_catalogue_skew(dest, engine_commit):
    """Say when the engine just moved past the catalogue it runs against.

    `refresh` updates the ENGINE and nothing else, by design -- taking the
    practice catalogue is a separate, deliberate step (INSTALL.md section 2),
    because installs are adapted and an unattended mirror is the mechanism
    class that loses content. The cost of that separation is a skew nobody
    was told about: engine code that cites a practice slug the vendored
    catalogue predates.

    THE REMEDY THIS NOTICE NAMES IS DELIBERATELY NOT `checkin.py update`.
    Its first version suggested exactly that, and the suggestion was worse
    than silence: checkin.py's `_default_branch()` resolves
    `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` unconditionally, so on every consumer pinned
    to `precedent-beta-v01` -- which is all of them, until the phase-7
    fold-in -- following the advice mirrors `main` over the vendored tree
    and DELETES the very practices this notice says are missing. Caught
    2026-09-06 by the consumer session that read the notice, recognized the
    trap, and did the manual mirror instead; spec/MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md's
    "The default-branch gotcha" is the same finding from the other side.
    UPDATE, later the same day: checkin.py HAS since been taught the pin.
    All four of its commands -- `fresh`, `update`, `record`, `push` -- now
    read `upstream.branch` from the consuming repo's own
    `process/manifest.json` and fall back to the clone's default only when
    no pin is recorded, and `record` no longer checks the clone out either.
    Seven harness cases assert it, each with a negative control.

    The remedy named below still points at the manual mirror anyway, and
    that is a deliberate hold rather than an oversight. What these two
    documents guard against is an UNATTENDED job overwriting a repo's
    vendored tree; the fix that would let them relax is hours old at the
    time of writing, and the two error directions are not symmetric --
    telling people the automation is safe when it is not costs a silent
    overnight wipe, while staying cautious costs a stale sentence. Morgan's
    call, 2026-09-06: record that the pin works, keep the manual remedy,
    and revisit once the fix has survived real sync cycles. So this is now
    a "not yet", not a "cannot" -- do not read it as the latter and do not
    quietly flip it either; that flip is a decision, and it has an owner.

    2026-09-27: the notice now names `checkin.py update` for a repo pinned
    to SOURCE_BRANCH, which is not that flip. The hold covers a pin OTHER
    than the clone's default, and checkin.py's own `_pinned_branch_hold`
    stops firing by itself once the pin is the default -- which it is for
    every install since the 2026-09-25 move to main. Sending those installs
    to the manual mirror sent a consumer session hunting for a route it did
    not need (2026-09-27). A non-default pin still gets the manual mirror.

    Reached a real consumer on 2026-09-06. A refresh took the engine to a
    commit whose `precedent_resolve.py` cites `source-naming` three times,
    while `process/upstream/` still sat 5 commits back and had no
    `practices/source-naming.md` -- so the repo's own `code-cites-practice`
    check reported three violations for a slug that does exist upstream, in
    code the consumer is not allowed to edit. Nothing in the refresh had
    said the two halves were now different ages.

    Reports, never fails: the skew is legitimate between an engine refresh
    and the catalogue update that follows it, and this runs at the moment
    the person is right there to act on it. Practice fail-gracefully: keep
    going, and tell the human.

    THE GAP THIS CLOSES. record_ci_workflow_files() already does the right

    it was reachable only from inside precedent_install.py/precedent_

    session could run a full `refresh` against a live BestPractice clone
    mid-incident without either leaving the hash stale -- refused by the
    next refresh -- or accepting `refresh --force`
    overwriting the hand-authored fix with the generic template). A session
    in that position needs a supported way to say "this content is correct
