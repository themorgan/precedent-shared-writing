"""precedent_vendor_engine.py — vendors Precedent's engine into a repo that
consumes it, as real tracked files instead of an undocumented hand-copy.
Two KINDS, sharing one mechanism:

  'source'   — an individual or team practice SET (precedent-individual,
               precedent-team-maintainers, precedent-team-tms). Needs only
               ENGINE_FILES: enough to run its own AGENTS.md loader block
               (precedent_show.py's Rule/Detail/Why/Story/Install split,
               build_views.py's `--agents-only` regeneration,
               precedent_paths.py's path-trigger channel, precedent_gate.py's
               closed gate vocabulary). This is the original, narrower case
               this tool closed first — see spec/BOOTSTRAP_NEW_SOURCES.md.

  'consumer' — a real four-source CONSUMER repo (universal + team +
               individual + repo-local, a vendored process/upstream/, the
               full precedent_materialize.py/precedent_resolve.py/
               precedent_sync_views.py toolchain that resolves all of them
               into one materialized tree). Needs CONSUMER_ENGINE_FILES:
               everything 'source' needs, PLUS those three multi-source
               tools — see TODO.md item 18 and this repo's own
               engine-plus-host-shims practice ("domain-neutral mechanism
               lives in the vendored tree"). Piloted 2026-09-05 against
               a private consumer repo — INSTALL.md §1 step 12 and §2
               step 6 document the consumer-repo procedure this closes.

THE GAP 'source' CLOSED FIRST. tools/precedent_bootstrap_source.py has only
ever written practice content, config, approvers and the leak-blocklist —
never an engine file. Every individual/team set that existed before this
tool got its tools/build_views.py, precedent_gate.py, precedent_paths.py,
precedent_show.py and split_practices.py into place by an undocumented,
one-off hand-copy, so none of them could tell a stale copy from a current
one, and precedent-team-tms's copy was simply missing outright.

THE GAP 'consumer' CLOSES. A real consumer's own tools/ needing the same
treatment was named explicitly as future work when 'source' shipped
(TODO.md item 18: "not piloted... deliberately not folded into the
source-repo fix"). A private consumer repo — a real four-source
consumer, not a fixture — had the identical undocumented-hand-copy problem
'source' closed for practice sets: its top-level tools/ held
build_views.py, precedent_gate.py, precedent_paths.py, precedent_show.py,
split_practices.py, precedent_materialize.py, precedent_resolve.py and
precedent_sync_views.py, all copied in by hand at some point in the past
with no manifest, no recorded source commit, and (confirmed 2026-09-05) six
of those eight files had already drifted from BestPractice's current
tools/ — including the --repo-awareness fix (commit 7c8d33d) and the
repo-local `path: "."` safety fix (commit 29148bc's sibling changes to
precedent_resolve.py/precedent_materialize.py), silently missing from the
consumer's copy the whole time.

Distinct from tools/checkin.py, which mirrors a CONSUMER's whole
process/upstream/ tree, deleting anything the tree no longer has, in BOTH
directions (a consumer pulls upstream content AND pushes its own
check-ins back). This engine is one-directional in both kinds —
downstream from BestPractice only, since neither a source set nor a
consumer's own tools/ has engine code of its own to contribute back — and
it sits inside tools/ ALONGSIDE non-vendored, repo-owned files (tools/checks/,
routing_scope.json is vendored but trimmed, a source set's own
build_codeowners.py, a consumer's own bootstrap.sh/light_check.py/
report_automation_issue.py) that a whole-directory mirror-and-delete would
destroy. So this is a NEW, narrower tool, not an extension of checkin.py:
it touches only the files it knows about, by name, per kind.

ENGINE_FILES / CONSUMER_ENGINE_FILES both name this script itself last, on
purpose: it travels WITH the engine it defines, so a future improvement to
the vendoring mechanism itself reaches every already-vendored repo the same
way an improvement to build_views.py does — not a second, undocumented gap
one layer up from the one this tool closes. precedent_materialize.py/
precedent_resolve.py/precedent_sync_views.py are never in ENGINE_FILES
(source) — a source set has no process/upstream/ and nothing to resolve
against more than one tree — but they ARE in CONSUMER_ENGINE_FILES
(consumer), where resolving four sources into one materialized tree is the
entire point.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY IN NEITHER LIST, said out loud because its absence is
what makes a whole class of follow-up work unnecessary. verify_harness.py
(noted again below), and also tools/leak_gate.py and tools/very_deep_check.py:
both run only from a BestPractice checkout, against whatever repositories that
session can see, so improving them reaches every repo the moment this repo's
own copy changes. Nothing to vendor, nothing to refresh.

That is worth stating because the opposite is the natural assumption. On
2026-09-07 a change to those two tools was written up as needing a
per-set engine refresh, and a TODO item was opened saying the sets were
running stale copies -- of files they have never held. The reasoning came
from cross-source-rollout, which is a real practice and simply did not apply
here; nobody checked these lists first. Check them before costing a rollout.

routing_scope.json is vendored in both kinds too, but it is not a
byte-identical copy: precedent_gate.py's SCOPE file carries two things in
this repo — the closed GATE vocabulary (`gates`, the moments a practice can
fire at, which is the same everywhere Precedent's loader runs, regardless
of kind) and a `practices` key documenting the routing reason for every one
of BestPractice's OWN 60-odd practices, which has no meaning in either a
source set or a consumer repo with a different catalogue entirely.
`_trim_routing_scope` below keeps only the first and drops the second — the
same trim a prior, undocumented hand-copy already applied by hand to every
repo that needed it (precedent-individual, precedent-team-maintainers, and
and a private consumer repo's own top-level tools/routing_scope.json, all three
confirmed byte-identical to this function's output before this tool
existed, or was extended to the consumer kind); this tool just makes that
trim mechanical instead of a fact only the session that did it once
remembered.

Four subcommands:

  seed <dest-dir> [--kind source|consumer]
                                  Run from BESTPRACTICE'S OWN checkout (the
                                  case tools/precedent_bootstrap_source.py
                                  needs — no clone required, the source IS
                                  this checkout). --kind defaults to
                                  'source' (unchanged CLI/API for every
                                  existing caller — precedent_bootstrap_
                                  source.py calls seed(dest) with no kind
                                  argument at all, and gets the same
                                  narrower set it always has). Copies the
                                  kind's file list and a trimmed
                                  routing_scope.json into <dest-dir>/tools/,
                                  and writes
                                  <dest-dir>/tools/ENGINE_MANIFEST.json
                                  recording this checkout's HEAD commit,
                                  the kind, and a sha256 per vendored file.

  status <bestpractice-clone>    Run from an ALREADY-VENDORED repo of
                                  either kind (same shape checkin.py's
                                  verbs use): reads `kind` back out of
                                  ENGINE_MANIFEST.json (no --kind flag
                                  needed — the manifest already says which
                                  file list applies) and compares the
                                  vendored files against its recorded
                                  hashes (local hand-edit?) and against the
                                  clone's current tools/ (upstream moved?).
                                  Exit 1 if either differs.

  refresh <bestpractice-clone> [--force] [--from-ref REF]
                                  Same kind auto-detection as status. Pulls
                                  the clone's SOURCE_BRANCH (see below —
                                  NOT the clone's configured default
                                  branch), refuses if a vendored file was
                                  hand-edited since the last seed/refresh
                                  (its sha256 no longer matches
                                  ENGINE_MANIFEST.json) unless --force, then
                                  re-copies + re-trims (the kind's own file
                                  list) and updates the manifest.

  fresh                          Clone-free staleness notice, no argument
                                  needed: one `git ls-remote` of
                                  ENGINE_MANIFEST.json's recorded repo,
                                  compared to the recorded commit. Always
                                  exits 0 (a notice, never a gate); silent
                                  on network failure vs. loud on a fast,
                                  clean failure (checkin.py's fresh() carries
                                  the same distinction and the same reason:
                                  an unreachable remote must never read as
                                  "confirmed fresh").

Run (from an already-vendored repo's own checkout, either kind):
  python3 tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py fresh
  python3 tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py status  ../BestPractice
  python3 tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py refresh ../BestPractice

Run once, from BestPractice's own checkout, to vendor a NEW consumer repo
(status/refresh above then work unchanged, kind auto-detected):
  python3 tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py seed <consumer-repo> --kind consumer

SOURCE_BRANCH is 'precedent-beta-v01', not BestPractice's configured
default branch ('main') — see local/practices/merge-target-is-beta-branch.md:
until Alex's deliberate phase-7 fold-in, routine engine work lands on
precedent-beta-v01, and 'main' is stale for this purpose. That practice's
own retirement clause applies here too: the moment the fold-in happens,
change SOURCE_BRANCH to 'main' in this one place, in the same PR.

    THE GAP THIS CLOSES. `refresh` only ever added and overwrote. Rename or

    updates it, and nobody can tell whether it still does something. That is
    exactly the state `decommission-deletes-files` exists to prevent,
    produced by the tool that distributes that practice.

    Found 2026-09-07 while costing the retirement->decommission rename:
    `precedent_decommission.py` is in the consumer engine set, so renaming it
    would have pushed the new name into every consumer and left the old one
    beside it, in perpetuity, in two repos today and every future one.

    WHY THIS IS SAFE, and it rests entirely on the manifest. The only files
    considered are ones the PREVIOUS manifest recorded as vendored here --
    written by this tool, into a directory the consuming repo also keeps its
    own files in. A file the engine never wrote is never a candidate, so a
    repo's own tools/ cannot be touched no matter what it is named.

    A hand-edited file is kept and reported, never deleted. `_local_drift`
    already refuses the whole refresh over one unless --force is passed, so
    reaching here with a modified file means somebody asked to overwrite --
    which is not the same as asking to throw the edit away. Recovering a
    deleted file from git is easy only if it was committed; this costs one
    line of output and removes the case where it was not.

    READ-ONLY with respect to `clone`, deliberately and load-bearingly so.
    This used to run `git checkout SOURCE_BRANCH` and `git pull` in `clone`
    to get the files off disk, which moved the caller's repository:

      * for a person, it silently switched their own BestPractice checkout
        onto SOURCE_BRANCH, abandoning whatever branch they were on;
      * in CI, `clone` is the job's own workspace, so the checkout moved the
        workspace mid-job and every LATER step in that job silently ran
        against SOURCE_BRANCH instead of the commit under test. That cost
        several sessions of investigation on PR #110, where the step after
        this one reported a violation that was true of SOURCE_BRANCH and
        false of the commit being tested, with `git status` clean throughout
        (a branch checkout leaves no dirty file to notice).

    Blobs, not the working tree -- the same discipline tools/leak_gate.py
    holds, for the same reason: reading history must not disturb the tree
    the caller is standing in. A vendoring read needs file CONTENT at a
    commit, which `git show` gives without touching HEAD or the index.

    `kind` selects which file list to materialize -- the consumer kind
    vendors precedent_materialize/resolve/sync_views on top of the source

    `refresh` updates the ENGINE and nothing else, by design -- taking the
    practice catalogue is a separate, deliberate step (INSTALL.md section 2),
    because installs are adapted and an unattended mirror is the mechanism
    class that loses content. The cost of that separation is a skew nobody
    was told about: engine code that cites a practice slug the vendored
    catalogue predates.

    THE REMEDY THIS NOTICE NAMES IS DELIBERATELY NOT `checkin.py update`.
    Its first version suggested exactly that, and the suggestion was worse
    than silence: checkin.py's `_default_branch()` resolves
    `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` unconditionally, so on every consumer pinned
    to `precedent-beta-v01` -- which is all of them, until the phase-7
    fold-in -- following the advice mirrors `main` over the vendored tree
    and DELETES the very practices this notice says are missing. Caught
    2026-09-06 by the consumer session that read the notice, recognized the
    trap, and did the manual mirror instead; spec/MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md's
    "The default-branch gotcha" is the same finding from the other side.
    UPDATE, later the same day: checkin.py HAS since been taught the pin.
    All four of its commands -- `fresh`, `update`, `record`, `push` -- now
    read `upstream.branch` from the consuming repo's own
    `process/manifest.json` and fall back to the clone's default only when
    no pin is recorded, and `record` no longer checks the clone out either.
    Seven harness cases assert it, each with a negative control.

    The remedy named below still points at the manual mirror anyway, and
    that is a deliberate hold rather than an oversight. What these two
    documents guard against is an UNATTENDED job overwriting a repo's
    vendored tree; the fix that would let them relax is hours old at the
    time of writing, and the two error directions are not symmetric --
    telling people the automation is safe when it is not costs a silent
    overnight wipe, while staying cautious costs a stale sentence. Morgan's
    call, 2026-09-06: record that the pin works, keep the manual remedy,
    and revisit once the fix has survived real sync cycles. So this is now
    a "not yet", not a "cannot" -- do not read it as the latter and do not
    quietly flip it either; that flip is a decision, and it has an owner.

    Reached a real consumer on 2026-09-06. A refresh took the engine to a
    commit whose `precedent_resolve.py` cites `source-naming` three times,
    while `process/upstream/` still sat 5 commits back and had no
    `practices/source-naming.md` -- so the repo's own `code-cites-practice`
    check reported three violations for a slug that does exist upstream, in
    code the consumer is not allowed to edit. Nothing in the refresh had
    said the two halves were now different ages.

    Reports, never fails: the skew is legitimate between an engine refresh
    and the catalogue update that follows it, and this runs at the moment
    the person is right there to act on it. Practice fail-gracefully: keep
    going, and tell the human.

    WHY HERE (asked for by Morgan, 2026-09-09). An update to the vendored
    engine is the one moment somebody is deliberately looking at how a repo
    gets its practices -- and it is also when a new engine file arrives that
    the environment may not be configured for. A credential that was never
    set produces no error at any other time: the sources simply are not
    there, and a session reads the universal catalogue believing it has
    them all. See tools/precedent_source_credentials.py for what that costs
    and what was measured about the fix.

    Never gates. A vendor update is not the place to refuse work over an
    environment setting (practice: fail-gracefully)."""
