"""precedent_source_credentials.py -- answers one question, and supplies the
one mechanism that follows from it: does this session need a git credential
to reach its PRIVATE practice sources, and does it have one?

WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHAT WAS MEASURED (practice: cite-the-incident).
A private practice source -- someone's precedent-individual, a team's
precedent-team-* -- reaches a hosted session by being cloned. On Claude
Code's remote harness that clone needs read access granted per session by
the agent calling `add_repo`, and `add_repo` refuses across owners. On
2026-09-09, in a session whose initial source was `alex137/bestpractice`,
that refusal was reproduced as the session's very FIRST tool call:

    cross-tier adds are not supported in v1: requested
    "themorgan/precedent-individual" but session already has repos from
    owner(s) [alex137]

which closes the question TODO.md's `attach-private-sources` item left
open -- the initial source already counts as "has repos", so no ordering
of calls inside such a session can work. That session ran on the universal
catalogue alone: 0 team, 0 individual. Nothing was broken, and every
personal rule was silently absent, which is the failure mode AGENTS.md's
"no individual source resolved" gotcha already costs a working day to.

THE ROUTE THIS OPENS, AND EXACTLY HOW FAR IT IS VERIFIED. `add_repo` is
not the only way to hold a credential: an environment can carry one, and a
SessionStart hook can then clone with it, before any turn begins -- which
is the ordering the whole incident turns on. Measured 2026-09-09, in this
container, twice:

  * An authenticated HTTPS request to github.com LEAVES the sandbox and
    reaches GitHub's own authentication. `git ls-remote` with a deliberately
    invalid token answered `remote: Invalid username or token`, from GitHub,
    not a proxy error. So the transport is not what blocks a credentialed
    clone.
  * There is NO ambient credential for an arbitrary private repo: a bare
    `git ls-remote https://github.com/<private>` failed with
    `could not read Username for 'https://github.com'`, while the same call
    against a public repo succeeded. The harness's own git access is scoped
    to the repositories it attached.

A third measurement, of this file's own mechanism rather than the
environment: `git` invoked with the credential helper below and a
deliberately invalid PRECEDENT_GIT_TOKEN did NOT prompt for a username. It
sent the credential and GitHub rejected it -- `remote: Invalid username or
token` again, from the server. So the helper genuinely delivers a
credential to git, which is the part of this that could have been silently
inert.

VERIFIED 2026-09-10, closing the gap this paragraph used to hold open. A
real read-scoped PAT was set on the environment, and a brand-new container
came up with all four private sources already cloned before the first turn:
this tool reported OK, and precedent_resolve.py reported 146 practices from
6 sources (41 team, 13 individual) where the same repo had been resolving 89
from 1. No add_repo call was made or needed. So the whole path -- environment
variable, credential helper, SessionStart clone -- works end to end.

WHAT COST THREE DAYS, and it was never the token: the account held TWO
environments with the SAME NAME, and the values had been set on the one the
sessions were not running in. Three sessions across two fresh containers
measured zero PRECEDENT_* variables and concluded the runner did not pass
them through. Nobody asked how many environments the account had until
list_environments answered it in one call. Not established: whether the twin
was the whole cause, or the first save had also failed -- both fit what was
measured. The sequence is entry 29 in record/GOTCHAS_ARCHIVE.md.

A FOURTH, 2026-09-09, of the opt-in `inherit` mode: pointed at this
container's own GITHUB_TOKEN, a clone of a real cross-owner private set was
REFUSED by GitHub ("Invalid username or token"). That is the expected answer
-- a harness credential is scoped to the repositories the harness attached --
and it is why `inherit` is something a person asks for by name and never a
silent fallback. It does, however, take the measurement one notch further
than the invalid-token test above: a real credential was delivered and
evaluated by the server.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It never reads, prints, logs or stores the token. The
credential reaches git through a helper that reads the environment variable
itself, at call time -- so the secret is never in a command line (visible in
`ps`), never in a clone's .git/config, and never in the config file the
bootstrap writes. Every path here is designed on the assumption that a
token written anywhere on disk is a token that will be committed by
somebody, eventually.
