"""build_views.py — phase-2 generated views (PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md,
Sequence row 2: "make AGENTS.md, MAP.md, GLOSSARY.md and the index
generated"). Regenerates:

  - the loader block inside AGENTS.md, between the
    <!-- BEGIN GENERATED: precedent-loader --> / <!-- END GENERATED -->
    markers: the resident block (## Rule of every tier: resident practice),
    the occasion index (on-demand practices grouped by occasion), and the
    standing instruction. This is "the one generated file containing
    exactly three things" from "How an Agent Knows Which Practices to
    Load" -- AGENTS.md carries it because AGENTS.md is what a session
    already loads at start, rather than inventing a second file sessions
    would need to be told to also read.
  - MAP.md, in full (a generated file, not hand-authored).
  - GLOSSARY.md, in full, built from every practice's `defines:` field.

Hand-editing any of these three fails the check: rerun this script and diff
against the committed tree; any difference is a check failure (wired into
tools/verify_harness.py).

The resident block has a hard token ceiling (see RESIDENT_BUDGET_TOKENS
below, and PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md's "The Resident Budget" -- "target ~2,000
tokens, hard-capped"). Token count is approximated as words * 1.3 (no
tokenizer dependency; see (practice: computed-numbers-in-scripts), computed
numbers live in scripts -- this IS that script, not a number restated by
hand elsewhere). Exceeding the
cap fails the build outright: adding a resident practice must cost demoting
or retiring another, mechanically, not by discipline.

    which is what the standing instruction's pointer and

      declared private, actually public -> a private source's practice TEXT

      declared public, actually private -> a few practices do not
        materialize. Visible immediately, fixed by one line.

    The old default was the first of those, justified in precedent.json's

    accident". The opposite is true: omitting it is exactly how a public
    repo publishes by accident. Found 2026-09-07 in a real public consumer

# that block lands in AGENTS.md at the repository ROOT. The Rule was written
# in practices/, one directory down, so a sibling citation legal there --
# `[audience-register](audience-register.md)` -- resolves to nothing from the
# root and lands in a consuming repo as a hard doc_lint BROKEN RELATIVE LINK,
# inside a generated region no session in that repo is allowed to edit.
#
# Reported 2026-09-11 from a consuming repo taking a vendor update: an
# individual set's new practice carried the only link in the whole resident
# block and failed that repo's doc gate on an otherwise-clean update. It was
# patched at the source by dropping the markup, which holds by convention
# only -- the next resident practice to carry a link breaks every consuming
# repo the same way.
#
# WHAT IS NOT DONE HERE, and it is the constraint that shapes the rest:
# precedent_materialize.py's _rewrite_links may not mint an absolute URL
# naming a private repository, because a consuming repo can be public and a
# disclosure cannot be taken back. Neither may this. So every placement here
# is a REPO-RELATIVE path or nothing: a link whose destination cannot be
# reached from the block's own directory without escaping the repository is
# left exactly as its author wrote it, and said out loud on stderr rather

    itself cannot take that route: its practices/ IS the universal source
    (`path: "."`), and precedent_materialize.py refuses a self-referential
    source by name, since its output directory would be that source's only
    copy. So the sources are resolved IN MEMORY here instead -- the same
    resolver, the same precedence, nothing written to disk.

    PRIVATE SOURCES ARE EXCLUDED FROM A PUBLIC REPO'S BLOCK. The block is
    a tracked file; in a public repo, writing it publishes whatever it
    contains, permanently. Universal and repo-local sources are already
    public -- one is the repo itself, the other lives in its own tree. Team
    and individual sets are private repositories whose practice text has
    never been published, so rendering their clauses here is publication by
    another route: precedent_resolve.py already refuses to let a shared repo
    DECLARE an individual source, because "naming it here leaks its
    existence and location", and this is the same disclosure by a different
    door. Precedent's own repo is the public case, and
    decisions/2026-09-06-precedent-binds-itself.md rejected multi-source
    generated views THERE on exactly this ground. A repo says which it is
    with `"visibility": "public"` in precedent.json; absent that, nothing is
    excluded -- which is the right default, because the repos that most need
    the multi-source block are the private consumers.

    the generated views list only what is in force, so the ONLY way to reach a
