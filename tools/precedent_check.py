"""precedent_check.py — the ENFORCED loading channel, made real (phase 4).

PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md, "How an Agent Knows Which Practices to Load", names
four channels. Three were built in phase 2 and 3; this is the fourth:

    **Enforced.** Practices with `checked_by` are never loaded at all. The
    check's failure message *is* the rule, delivered at the moment of
    violation.

Before this existed, `checked_by:` was a *claim*: a string naming a script
that existed. The harness verified the file was there and nothing else, so
eight practices reported enforcement that nobody had ever seen fire. Tested
one by one at the start of phase 4, the eight came apart:
`readers-vocabulary` named a linter with no vocabulary check in it at all;
`acronyms-glossary` named a check that only ever warns; the two practices
naming `doc_sync.py` and the two naming `practice_audit.py` named gates that
were RED on this repository, for reasons that had nothing to do with either
practice. A claim nobody tested is worth less than no claim, because it
reads as coverage.

So this module is deliberately not "a script that checks practices". It is a
registry with one entry per enforced practice, and every entry owes two
things:

  * **a failure message that IS the rule.** On a violation the practice's
    own `## Rule` is printed, read through the same code path every other
    channel uses (`split_practices._read_practice_file`, via
    `precedent_show`'s reader) — never a paraphrase that can drift from it.
  * **a test that proves it fires.** tools/verify_harness.py plants a real
    violation for every registered slug in a throwaway repository and
    asserts the exit status, then asserts the unplanted baseline is clean.
    A slug registered here without a case there fails the harness.

A CHECK THAT CANNOT RUN REPORTS THAT IT DID NOT RUN. Every graceful-failure
path here ends in SKIPPED with a reason, never in a pass. This repository
has been bitten four times by the opposite -- a scan with an empty input set
printing OK -- and the whole point of an enforced practice is that its check
is the only thing standing where the prose used to be.

Scopes, because a practice is not always a property of a file:

  tree      a property of the repository as it stands (an index exists, the
            generated views are current). Always runs.
  change    a property of what a change adds or edits (a new practice
            carries its incident). Runs against the files in scope.
  turn-end  a property of the state you wanted AFTER an operation (nothing
            unpushed, no published history rewritten). Excluded from the
            default run -- mid-work it is not a violation -- and run by
            --turn-end, which is where a Stop hook calls it.

Run:
  python3 tools/precedent_check.py                  # tree + change scopes
  python3 tools/precedent_check.py --turn-end       # the end-of-turn scope
  python3 tools/precedent_check.py --only SLUG      # one practice
  python3 tools/precedent_check.py --paths A B      # explicit change scope
  python3 tools/precedent_check.py --all            # change scope = whole tree
  python3 tools/precedent_check.py --list           # what is registered
  python3 tools/precedent_check.py --explain        # what each check does NOT check
  python3 tools/precedent_check.py --strict         # a SKIP is a failure

    WHY THIS EXISTS. Until this ran, nothing anywhere invoked those
    scripts. `precedent_materialize.py` copied them in, `precedent_land.py`
    refused to land a team or individual practice without one, and

    The contract every one of those scripts already keeps, and this
    depends on: no arguments; `ROOT` derived from its own location

    as ERROR, which is neither a pass nor a violation.

    The slug is taken from whichever practice's `checked_by` names the
    script, so a finding names the practice and prints its Rule like
    every other check here -- falling back to the filename only when no

    because `register_materialized_checks()` can only see scripts that were
    materialized -- and Precedent cannot materialize into itself.

    ADVISORY, deliberately, to the bar this module sets for that (see
    parallel-artifact-ledger's own note): the remedy is an architectural
    decision -- wire the sources into this repo's generated views, or state
    per practice that it does not bind here -- and running the same 15
    source checks against this tree showed the answer is not simply "turn
    them all on": five pass, four report real findings, and six report
    things this repo cannot act on because the practice is about a
    different kind of repository. Failing the gate would leave it red until
    somebody makes that call, and a permanently red gate is a gate nobody
    runs, which is this repo's own documented lesson.

    A source that does not RESOLVE in this environment is skipped, never
    reported -- a team source is a sibling clone and an individual source
    resolves through a private user-level config, so neither exists in a
    bare CI checkout, and their absence there is not evidence of anything.

# were on disk, so the loader and every check read them and were right; in
# the pushed tree they did not exist, and a practice that does not exist
# violates nothing. The catalogue can lose a rule without anything saying so.

# The cheap, decidable half of that is this check. It does not attempt the
# general problem (did the catalogue silently shrink -- that needs a baseline
# to compare against, and is filed as `consumers-need-refresh-after-promotion`

    Function-level, not file-level, and that took three attempts to get
    right -- each earlier version passed its own negative control, which is
    the only reason the weakness showed at all.

    v1 asked whether the FILE contained the literal `get('base_branch')`.
    Deleting the helper from doc_lint.py and renaming it left that literal
    in the dead body, and the control came back green: a check a file
    passes by containing the right *words*.

    v2 asked whether the file made a real declared-branch CALL anywhere,
    via AST. Same control, same green -- the dead helper's call was still a
    call.

    v3, here, asks the actual question: the function doing the inferring
    must itself read a declaration, or be called by a function that does.
    The one-hop allowance is not slack; it is checkin.py's real shape,

    Measured on 2026-09-06, on a real checkout of that branch: SIX separate
    tools carried their own copy of the inference, and two were actively
    wrong. `doc_lint.default_branch()` returned the literal string 'HEAD'

    `changed_md()` diffed against a ref that does not resolve and returned
    ZERO files -- the markdown gate passing by scanning nothing.
    `doc_html._link_base()` emitted `/blob/main/` for content that exists
    only on the beta branch: every generated link dead.

    The duplication is deliberate and stays -- doc_lint.py and doc_html.py
    are meant to be droppable into a host repo alone, and doc_html.py's own
    docstring says so. So this does not demand a shared import. It demands

# cite-the-incident, 2026-09-05: this check was wired into CI the same day
# it was written (deep-check.yml) and immediately found a real, pre-existing
# gap -- templates/harness/LEDGER.md was missing a row for f2078d6, the
# commit that created the claude-code/codex/gemini-cli family in the first
# place, five weeks before the ledger file existed. That gap is fixed
# (backfilled in dfe504d). Two more, separately real fixes followed:
# b16b141 made the root/inception exemption above shallow-clone-safe (reads
# .git/shallow directly, since `git rev-list --max-parents=0` can't be
# trusted on a shallow checkout -- see this file's AGENTS.md for the
# general gotcha), and 2a0fbe0 added `fetch-depth: 0` to deep-check.yml's
# checkout (a real, repo-wide gap independent of this check).
#
# ROOT-CAUSED 2026-09-06 -- and it was never a false positive. The finding
# was true of the tree CI was actually standing on. verify_harness.py (step
# 5) invoked a vendored `precedent_vendor_engine.py refresh <ROOT> --force`,
# and refresh() then ran `git checkout precedent-beta-v01` + `git pull` in
# the clone it was handed -- which in CI is the job's own workspace. So step
# 5 moved the workspace onto the base branch, and precedent_check.py (step 6)
# ran the BASE branch's tree, where templates/harness/LEDGER.md genuinely has
# no row for f2078d6. The same substitution explains every other symptom:
# the summary line CI printed was the base branch's own pre-advisory format,
# and the diagnostic prints never appeared because by step 6 the file was no
# longer the file they had been added to. `git status` stays clean throughout
# -- a branch checkout leaves no dirty file to notice -- which is why four
# independent content verifications all came back correct while the workspace
# stood on a different commit. Reproduced deterministically: run
# verify_harness.py and then precedent_check.py in one checkout and the
# second reports this violation; run precedent_check.py alone on the same
# commit and it is clean. Fixed upstream in 25546bc (refresh() materializes
# blobs and never checks the clone out, with a regression case that fails
# against the pre-fix engine) and here by vendoring from a throwaway clone.
# Full account:
# https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/pull/110#issuecomment-5556343855
#
# So this check is ENFORCING again, as originally written: there was no
# platform mystery, and nothing left to except it from. The lesson worth
# keeping is diagnostic -- when a check's finding contradicts the tree you
# believe you are on, confirm WHICH COMMIT is actually checked out before
# concluding the check is wrong. Four rounds of content verification cannot
# distinguish a wrong answer from a right answer about a different tree.
