"""precedent_check.py — the ENFORCED loading channel, made real (phase 4).

PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md, "How an Agent Knows Which Practices to Load", names
four channels. Three were built in phase 2 and 3; this is the fourth:

    **Enforced.** Practices with `checked_by` are never loaded at all. The
    check's failure message *is* the rule, delivered at the moment of
    violation.

Before this existed, `checked_by:` was a *claim*: a string naming a script
that existed. The harness verified the file was there and nothing else, so
eight practices reported enforcement that nobody had ever seen fire. Tested
one by one at the start of phase 4, the eight came apart:
`readers-vocabulary` named a linter with no vocabulary check in it at all;
`acronyms-glossary` named a check that only ever warns; the two practices
naming `doc_sync.py` and the two naming `practice_audit.py` named gates that
were RED on this repository, for reasons that had nothing to do with either
practice. A claim nobody tested is worth less than no claim, because it
reads as coverage.

So this module is deliberately not "a script that checks practices". It is a
registry with one entry per enforced practice, and every entry owes two
things:

  * **a failure message that IS the rule.** On a violation the practice's
    own `## Rule` is printed, read through the same code path every other
    channel uses (`split_practices._read_practice_file`, via
    `precedent_show`'s reader) — never a paraphrase that can drift from it.
  * **a test that proves it fires.** tools/verify_harness.py plants a real
    violation for every registered slug in a throwaway repository and
    asserts the exit status, then asserts the unplanted baseline is clean.
    A slug registered here without a case there fails the harness.

A CHECK THAT CANNOT RUN REPORTS THAT IT DID NOT RUN. Every graceful-failure
path here ends in SKIPPED with a reason, never in a pass. This repository
has been bitten four times by the opposite -- a scan with an empty input set
printing OK -- and the whole point of an enforced practice is that its check
is the only thing standing where the prose used to be.

A RULE THIS REPO HAS SAID DOES NOT BIND IT REPORTS **EXEMPT**, and reports
it by name with the recorded reason. `not_binding` in precedent.json is
where a consuming repo declares that a pair -- this repo, this rule -- has
no relationship (precedent_resolve.load_not_binding). Until 2026-09-10 that
declaration did nothing to this module's run: only the reachability check
read it, so an exempted practice was still checked, still violated, still
counted, and there was no way for a consuming repo to declare a practice
non-binding and get a clean check. `severity: blocking` still cannot be
exempted. See load_exemptions().

Scopes, because a practice is not always a property of a file:

  tree      a property of the repository as it stands (an index exists, the
            generated views are current). Always runs.
  change    a property of what a change adds or edits (a new practice
            carries its incident). Runs against the files in scope.
  turn-end  a property of the state you wanted AFTER an operation (nothing
            unpushed, no published history rewritten). Excluded from the
            default run -- mid-work it is not a violation -- and run by
            --turn-end, which is where a Stop hook calls it.

Run:
  python3 tools/precedent_check.py                  # tree + change scopes
  python3 tools/precedent_check.py --turn-end       # the end-of-turn scope

    --explain -- a check's limits belong beside it, not in a document that
    drifts from it.

    `practice_backed=False` marks a check that enforces a property of the
    engine itself rather than a catalogue practice, so it has no
    `practices/<slug>.md` to be in force. Every other check is gated on
    its practice actually resolving in THIS repo (see `run()`): this file
    is vendored into consuming repos, and a check for a practice a
    consumer does not have is a finding it can never act on.

    `binds_publishers=True` marks a check whose subject is the practice
    FILES a repo publishes, so it binds any repo that publishes a
    practices/ tree even where that practice's own text is not vendored
    in. It exists because the gate below, correct for a consumer, is
    exactly wrong for a practice SOURCE set: a source set's practices/
    holds its own practices only, so every other level's check skips
    there -- permanently, since it resolves no sources and materializes
    nothing into itself. Measured 2026-09-12 in a team source: 12 checks
    passed and 42 SKIPPED, all 42 for that one reason. The cost was
    already paid once -- a practice file there shipped a relative link to
    a file materialization does not copy, live in the publishing set and
    dead in every repo that received the catalogue, and the rule that
    catches exactly that was one of the 42. A consuming repo found it, a
    sync late (practice: cite-the-incident).

    Set it only where the check's subject really is the published
    practice tree, and only where the check is known to FUNCTION in a
    source set -- the flag removes the gate, it does not make a check
    that needs resolved sources suddenly work without them.

    `advisory=True` is distinct from a practice's own frontmatter
    `severity:` field (precedent_resolve.py's `severity: blocking`, about
    which SOURCE wins when two levels disagree) -- this is about whether
    THIS enforced check's own findings fail the run. Not exposed as a CLI
    flag or a general mechanism: a check is advisory only when a specific,

    The contract every one of those scripts already keeps, and this

# wrong in both directions. It read
# `\bSource:\s*([^-]+?)\s*(?:--|—|\.|-->)`, which (a) could not cross a
# hyphen, so a real clause naming `business-modeling/doc-recipes/x.recipe.md`
# did not match AT ALL and the file was reported as carrying no `Source:`
# clause -- sending the reader to look for a clause sitting right there in the
# header -- and (b) terminated on any `.`, so even a hyphen-free
# `Source: docs/plain.md -- fine` captured `docs/plain` and was reported as a
# path that does not exist. Hyphenated paths are the common case in these
# repos, not the edge case, so the rule was close to unsatisfiable: both
# failure messages pointed at the wrong problem, and a session trying to
# COMPLY had no way to. Found 2026-09-11 from a consuming repo while adding a
# clause to a generated header.
#
# What actually ends a clause, and why each terminator is written the way it
# is:
#   `-->`        the end of the HTML comment. Matched with no whitespace
#                requirement, and FIRST, so it wins over the `--` inside it.
#   whitespace + `--`
#                this project's prose dash. The lookbehind is the fix for (a):
#                a hyphen inside a path is never preceded by whitespace, so
#                `doc-recipes/` reads as path and ` -- the recipe` reads as the
#                end of the clause.
#   `—`          an em dash never occurs in a path, so it needs no guard.
#   `.` + whitespace or end
#                a sentence-ending period. The lookahead is the fix for (b):
#                an extension's dot is always followed by its extension, never
#                by a space, so `.md ` no longer truncates. Dropping `.`
#                altogether was the alternative and is worse -- without it a
#                clause written as a sentence swallows the rest of the comment,
#                and every path-shaped token in that prose is then checked as
#                if the header had named it.
#   end of text  a clause with no terminator at all captures to the end rather
#                than failing to match, because "no `Source:` clause" is the
#                one message that must mean what it says.
#
# WHAT THE CLAUSE MAY NAME is the second question, and it was got wrong for
# a different reason (found 2026-09-12, from a consuming repo, on a file
# MIRRORED in from the repo that builds it). The grammar assumed the source
# is a path in the repo the header is sitting in. For a mirrored artifact
# that is never true, and the three wordings tried were wrong three
# different ways: no clause at all (correctly refused); the source's own
# in-repo paths, which do not exist in the mirror, so the check reported
# them as a Source that had MOVED -- by the practice's own reasoning a worse
# state than none; and a URL to the building repo, which reads correctly to
# a human and matches no path, so it was refused as naming nothing.
#
# So the clause takes an optional parenthetical naming the PLACE the source
# lives in, and that is the whole grammar addition:
#
#   Source: practices/                  -- in this repo. Every path must exist.
#   Source (in the Voice pack): voice/  -- somewhere else. Not resolvable here.
#
# The parenthetical is free text on purpose. Demanding a fixed phrase would
# reproduce the exact failure PR #246 fixed -- a near-miss reported as "no
# clause", sending a reader to hunt for something sitting in front of them --
# and the author is the one who knows what to call the place. What the check
# takes from it is one bit: this repository is not where the answer is.
#
# WHY NOT JUST ACCEPT A URL, which is the obvious move. Because the repo that
# builds a mirrored artifact is often PRIVATE, and both private-repo-scrub and
# precedent_materialize.py's _rewrite_links already refuse to mint a URL
# naming a private repo into content that ships -- "a relative link that does
# not resolve is a smaller failure than a disclosure that cannot be taken
# back". A check that made a URL the only way to comply would be pulling
# against that rule from the other side. The parenthetical takes a URL where
# naming it is fine and a plain label where it is not, so the leak gate stays
# the only thing deciding which -- this check never has an opinion about it.

    `precedent.json` declaring a source is a claim that its practices bind
    work here. Four channels can make good on that claim -- the resident
    block, the occasion index, a path trigger, and an enforced check (plus
    gates, which fire at a moment). A practice that none of them reaches is
    a rule nobody will ever be shown, in a repo that says it is in force:
    the config and the loader disagree, and the config is the one that
    reads as authoritative.

    Measured here on 2026-09-06: 30 of 114 practices in force in Precedent's
    own repo were reachable by nothing at all -- 27 from the team source and
    3 from the individual one. Both are genuinely declared in
    `precedent.json` and in the user-level config; neither reaches
    `AGENTS.md`'s generated block, because `build_views.py` deliberately
    stays single-source here, and neither reaches the enforced channel,
    because `register_materialized_checks()` can only see scripts that were
    materialized -- and Precedent cannot materialize into itself.

    ADVISORY, deliberately, to the bar this module sets for that (see
    parallel-artifact-ledger's own note): the remedy is an architectural
    decision -- wire the sources into this repo's generated views, or state
    per practice that it does not bind here -- and running the same 15
    source checks against this tree showed the answer is not simply "turn
    them all on": five pass, four report real findings, and six report
    things this repo cannot act on because the practice is about a
    different kind of repository. Failing the gate would leave it red until
    somebody makes that call, and a permanently red gate is a gate nobody
    runs, which is this repo's own documented lesson.

    A source that does not RESOLVE in this environment is skipped, never
    reported -- a team source is a sibling clone and an individual source
    resolves through a private user-level config, so neither exists in a
    bare CI checkout, and their absence there is not evidence of anything.

# routing_scope.json, which precedent_gate.py itself names via
# `_ENGINE_DIR / 'routing_scope.json'` -- discovered only when someone
# actually tried to run a gate, not before. This check statically scans every
# tools/*.py file for exactly that shape of hardcoded reference and flags any
# target that isn't actually there, so the same class of gap (a vendored
# engine file naming a companion that never got copied) surfaces mechanically
# on the next `precedent_check.py` run instead of via a downstream crash.
# cite-the-incident, 2026-09-07: promoting two practices to the universal
# catalogue did every part of the job except the job. `git commit -a` does
# not stage an untracked file, so `practices/fail-gracefully.md` and
# `practices/bold-key-phrases.md` were written, regenerated into every view,
# given routing entries, deleted from both team sets -- and never added.
#
# For one pushed commit the two rules were in force NOWHERE: gone from both
# team sets, absent from the repository they had been promoted into. EVERY
# GATE PASSED, in both directions, and neither is a bug: locally the files
# were on disk, so the loader and every check read them and were right; in
# the pushed tree they did not exist, and a practice that does not exist
# violates nothing. The catalogue can lose a rule without anything saying so.
#
# The cheap, decidable half of that is this check. It does not attempt the
# general problem (did the catalogue silently shrink -- that needs a baseline
# to compare against, and is filed as `consumers-need-refresh-after-promotion`
# for the consumer-side version of the same shape). It asserts only that what
# a session can SEE is what the repository actually HAS.

    Function-level, not file-level, and that took three attempts to get
    right -- each earlier version passed its own negative control, which is
    the only reason the weakness showed at all.

    v1 asked whether the FILE contained the literal `get('base_branch')`.
    Deleting the helper from doc_lint.py and renaming it left that literal
    in the dead body, and the control came back green: a check a file
    passes by containing the right *words*.

    v2 asked whether the file made a real declared-branch CALL anywhere,
    via AST. Same control, same green -- the dead helper's call was still a
    call.

    v3, here, asks the actual question: the function doing the inferring
    must itself read a declaration, or be called by a function that does.
    The one-hop allowance is not slack; it is checkin.py's real shape,

    tools carried their own copy of the inference, and two were actively
    wrong. `doc_lint.default_branch()` returned the literal string 'HEAD'

    `changed_md()` diffed against a ref that does not resolve and returned
    ZERO files -- the markdown gate passing by scanning nothing.
    `doc_html._link_base()` emitted `/blob/main/` for content that exists
    only on the beta branch: every generated link dead.

    The duplication is deliberate and stays -- doc_lint.py and doc_html.py
    are meant to be droppable into a host repo alone, and doc_html.py's own
    docstring says so. So this does not demand a shared import. It demands

# dependent repo, that document is templates/GETTING_STARTED.md's
# administrator section". This check read a root GITHUB_ACTIONS.md and
# nothing else. And INSTALL.md §1 step 6's root-hygiene list names
# GITHUB_ACTIONS.md among the files that exist ONLY under
# `process/upstream/` and must never be copied to the root. So a dependent
# repo that FOLLOWED the practice failed the check, and one that satisfied
# the check tripped root hygiene -- unless it wrote its own,
# differently-scoped GITHUB_ACTIONS.md, which nothing asked it to. The
# check's own "blind to" text half-admitted it ("a README section would
# satisfy the practice's intent but not this check").
#
# Settled in the Rule's favour, because the Rule is the one of the three
# that carries the reasoning: the destination is "the document that
# project's own people actually read", and in a dependent repo that is
# GETTING_STARTED.md, which root hygiene explicitly DOES place at the root.
#
# Both are read, rather than swapping one hard-coded filename for another.
# GITHUB_ACTIONS.md stays a valid home for a repo that has its own --
# BestPractice itself is exactly that repo, being the upstream, and its
# root copy is its own document rather than a vendored one. A repo that
# discloses in either has disclosed.

# cite-the-incident, 2026-09-05: this check was wired into CI the same day
# it was written (deep-check.yml) and immediately found a real, pre-existing
# gap -- templates/harness/LEDGER.md was missing a row for f2078d6, the
# commit that created the claude-code/codex/gemini-cli family in the first
# place, five weeks before the ledger file existed. That gap is fixed
# (backfilled in dfe504d). Two more, separately real fixes followed:
# b16b141 made the root/inception exemption above shallow-clone-safe (reads
# .git/shallow directly, since `git rev-list --max-parents=0` can't be
# trusted on a shallow checkout -- see this file's AGENTS.md for the
# general gotcha), and 2a0fbe0 added `fetch-depth: 0` to deep-check.yml's
# checkout (a real, repo-wide gap independent of this check).
#
# ROOT-CAUSED 2026-09-06 -- and it was never a false positive. The finding
# was true of the tree CI was actually standing on. verify_harness.py (step
# 5) invoked a vendored `precedent_vendor_engine.py refresh <ROOT> --force`,
# and refresh() then ran `git checkout precedent-beta-v01` + `git pull` in
# the clone it was handed -- which in CI is the job's own workspace. So step
# 5 moved the workspace onto the base branch, and precedent_check.py (step 6)
# ran the BASE branch's tree, where templates/harness/LEDGER.md genuinely has
# no row for f2078d6. The same substitution explains every other symptom:
# the summary line CI printed was the base branch's own pre-advisory format,
# and the diagnostic prints never appeared because by step 6 the file was no
# longer the file they had been added to. `git status` stays clean throughout
# -- a branch checkout leaves no dirty file to notice -- which is why four
# independent content verifications all came back correct while the workspace
# stood on a different commit. Reproduced deterministically: run
# verify_harness.py and then precedent_check.py in one checkout and the
# second reports this violation; run precedent_check.py alone on the same
# commit and it is clean. Fixed upstream in 25546bc (refresh() materializes
# blobs and never checks the clone out, with a regression case that fails
# against the pre-fix engine) and here by vendoring from a throwaway clone.
# Full account:
# https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/pull/110#issuecomment-5556343855
#
# So this check is ENFORCING again, as originally written: there was no
# platform mystery, and nothing left to except it from. The lesson worth
# keeping is diagnostic -- when a check's finding contradicts the tree you
# believe you are on, confirm WHICH COMMIT is actually checked out before
# concluding the check is wrong. Four rounds of content verification cannot
# distinguish a wrong answer from a right answer about a different tree.

def load_exemptions():
    """{slug: reason} for the practices this repo declared `not_binding`
    and that may actually be exempted, plus the slugs whose exemption is
    REFUSED because the practice is `severity: blocking`.

    WHY THIS EXISTS, and what was broken without it (2026-09-10).
    precedent_resolve.load_not_binding()'s own docstring describes the
    mechanism exactly -- "whether a rule binds is a property of the PAIR,
    not of the rule: `commit-author` binds a repo one person authors alone
    and not one with many contributors" -- and this module read that list
    in exactly ONE place, `_unreachable_practices`, where it only ever
    suppressed a REACHABILITY finding. `main()` built its slug list from
    `sorted(CHECKS)` and never consulted it at all, so declaring
    `{"slug": "commit-author", "reason": "..."}` in a consuming repo's
    precedent.json changed nothing about the run: the practice was still
    checked, still violated, still counted, still exit 1. There was NO WAY
    for a consuming repo to declare a practice non-binding and get a clean
    check, and a real install ended on two permanent violations it had
    written reasoned exemptions for. The 17 entries in
    templates/document-project/precedent.json were, for check
    purposes, decorative.

    EXEMPTED IS ITS OWN STATUS, never silence. Dropping these slugs from
    the run would trade one problem for a worse one -- an exemption that
    leaves no trace in the output is how a rule gets switched off and
    forgotten. They are reported by name, with their recorded reasons, and
    counted in their own summary category.

    `severity: blocking` may not be exempted, the same rule
    _unreachable_practices already applies, for the same reason: a
    blocking practice is exactly the one no downstream declaration is
    allowed to switch off. A refused exemption runs normally here; the
    reachability check is what reports the refusal itself as a finding, so
    it is stated once rather than twice."""
