"""The ENFORCED loading channel — runs every practice's `checked_by` script

precedent_check.py — the ENFORCED loading channel, made real (phase 4).

PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md, "How an Agent Knows Which Practices to Load", names
four channels. Three were built in phase 2 and 3; this is the fourth:

    **Enforced.** Practices with `checked_by` are never loaded at all. The
    check's failure message *is* the rule, delivered at the moment of
    violation.

Before this existed, `checked_by:` was a *claim*: a string naming a script
that existed. The harness verified the file was there and nothing else, so
eight practices reported enforcement that nobody had ever seen fire. Tested
one by one at the start of phase 4, the eight came apart:
`readers-vocabulary` named a linter with no vocabulary check in it at all;
`acronyms-glossary` named a check that only ever warns; the two practices
naming `doc_sync.py` and the two naming `practice_audit.py` named gates that
were RED on this repository, for reasons that had nothing to do with either
practice. A claim nobody tested is worth less than no claim, because it
reads as coverage.

So this module is deliberately not "a script that checks practices". It is a
registry with one entry per enforced practice, and every entry owes two
things:

  * **a failure message that IS the rule.** On a violation the practice's
    own `## Rule` is printed, read through the same code path every other
    channel uses (`split_practices._read_practice_file`, via
    `precedent_show`'s reader) — never a paraphrase that can drift from it.
  * **a test that proves it fires.** tools/verify_harness.py plants a real
    violation for every registered slug in a throwaway repository and
    asserts the exit status, then asserts the unplanted baseline is clean.
    A slug registered here without a case there fails the harness.

A CHECK THAT CANNOT RUN REPORTS THAT IT DID NOT RUN. Every graceful-failure
path here ends in SKIPPED with a reason, never in a pass. This repository
has been bitten four times by the opposite -- a scan with an empty input set
printing OK -- and the whole point of an enforced practice is that its check
is the only thing standing where the prose used to be.

A RULE THIS REPO HAS SAID DOES NOT BIND IT REPORTS **EXEMPT**, and reports
it by name with the recorded reason. `not_binding` in precedent.json is
where a consuming repo declares that a pair -- this repo, this rule -- has
no relationship (precedent_resolve.load_not_binding). Until 2026-09-10 that
declaration did nothing to this module's run: only the reachability check
read it, so an exempted practice was still checked, still violated, still
counted, and there was no way for a consuming repo to declare a practice
non-binding and get a clean check. `severity: blocking` still cannot be
exempted. See load_exemptions().

"THE CHECK RAN" AND "THE PRACTICE IS IN FORCE" ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS,
and this module treats them as one. Said plainly because the difference is
invisible from the output, and a session has been misled by it:

  the check ran         a practices/<slug>.md file EXISTS -- at any status
                        -- or the check carries binds_publishers and this
                        repo publishes practices. That is the whole of
                        run()'s gate: `_practice_file(slug) is None`, which
                        looks for the file and reads nothing inside it.
  the practice is in    the file exists AND its frontmatter `status` is in
  force                 force. A file at `deduplicated` or `retired` is not
                        in force, is excluded from every generated view,
                        and STILL SWITCHES ITS CHECK ON.

LEFT THAT WAY DELIBERATELY, decided 2026-09-13. Enforcing a withdrawn
practice is harmless -- the rule is either in force one level up
(`deduplicated`) or nobody wants it anywhere (`retired`, rare and loud), and
in neither case does running the check make something wrong happen.
binds_publishers now covers the cases that motivated the question. Changing
the gate to read `status` would be a behaviour change nobody asked for, in
every consuming repo at once, and `rule_of()` needs the file to exist in
order to print anything at all.

THE CONSEQUENCE THAT COSTS SOMETHING, which is why this is written down
rather than shrugged at: **a session verifying that a local re-declaration is
no longer load-bearing cannot do it by deduplicating the file and seeing the
check still pass.** File presence alone produces that result, so the weak
test "confirms" the removal while proving nothing. The decisive test is
removing the file entirely. That is how a shared set's re-declared
catalogue-carries-stories copy was actually verified on 2026-09-13; the
weaker test would have passed just as readily on a copy that was still the
only thing switching the check on.

Scopes, because a practice is not always a property of a file:

  tree      a property of the repository as it stands (an index exists, the
            generated views are current). Always runs.
  change    a property of what a change adds or edits (a new practice
            carries its incident). Runs against the files in scope.
  turn-end  a property of the state you wanted AFTER an operation (nothing
            unpushed, no published history rewritten). Excluded from the
            default run -- mid-work it is not a violation -- and run by
            --turn-end, which is where a Stop hook calls it.

Run:
  python3 tools/precedent_check.py                  # tree + change scopes
  python3 tools/precedent_check.py --turn-end       # the end-of-turn scope

                                                    # not just this commit's
                                                    # touched + rotation slice
  python3 tools/precedent_check.py --list           # what is registered
  python3 tools/precedent_check.py --explain        # what each check does NOT check
  python3 tools/precedent_check.py --strict         # a SKIP, or a thing a
                                                    # check COULD NOT VERIFY,
                                                    # is a failure

A bare run does NOT sweep every `tree`-scope check every time (Morgan,
2026-09-18): each run covers a check whose own practice file or a matching
applies_to path was touched this commit, plus a rotating 1/10th slice of
whatever's left, so a check skipped this commit is covered within 10
commits -- guaranteed by the commit count, never left to chance. See
_scoped_tree_slugs()'s own docstring for the exact rule. `change`-scope
checks are unaffected; they already self-limit to the diff, every run.

    """Register a check. `blind_to` is what it does NOT catch, printed by
    --explain -- a check's limits belong beside it, not in a document that
    drifts from it.

    `practice_backed=False` marks a check that enforces a property of the
    engine itself rather than a catalogue practice, so it has no
    `practices/<slug>.md` to be in force. Every other check is gated on
    its practice actually resolving in THIS repo (see `run()`): this file
    is vendored into consuming repos, and a check for a practice a
    consumer does not have is a finding it can never act on.

    `binds_publishers=True` marks a check whose subject is the practice
    FILES a repo publishes, so it binds any repo that publishes a
    practices/ tree even where that practice's own text is not vendored
    in. It exists because the gate below, correct for a consumer, is
    exactly wrong for a practice SOURCE set: a source set's practices/
    holds its own practices only, so every other level's check skips
    there -- permanently, since it resolves no sources and materializes
    nothing into itself. Measured 2026-09-12 in a shared source: 12 checks
    passed and 42 SKIPPED, all 42 for that one reason. The cost was
    already paid once -- a practice file there shipped a relative link to
    a file materialization does not copy, live in the publishing set and
    dead in every repo that received the catalogue, and the rule that
    catches exactly that was one of the 42. A consuming repo found it, a
    sync late (practice: cite-the-incident).

    Set it only where the check's subject really is the published
    practice tree, and only where the check is known to FUNCTION in a
    source set -- the flag removes the gate, it does not make a check
    that needs resolved sources suddenly work without them.

    `binds_when` is a tuple of repo-relative paths whose PRESENCE is the
    repo's own opt-in, and lifts the same gate. Some rules are carried by
    a registry file a repo maintains rather than by the practice text: a
    repo that wrote a number down has asked for it to be enforced, and
    making it ALSO vendor the practice file is a second, undocumented
    condition nobody meets on purpose.

    The cost, measured 2026-09-22: `precedent-individual` declares its
    surfaces and their ceilings in `tools/session_load_budgets.json` and
    does not carry `practices/session-load-budget.md`. So `AGENTS.md`
    sat at 2,276 tokens against the 1,800 that registry declares -- 476
    tokens, 26% over -- with every check green, and the skip line read
    "this check belongs to a source this repo does not resolve", which is
    true of the practice and wrong about the registry: the registry was
    right there.
    It surfaced because somebody ran `tools/session_load_trend.py` by
    hand.

    The same reasoning as `binds_publishers` and the same bar: set it
    only where the named file really is the subject, and only where the
    check FUNCTIONS without the practice text -- a check whose findings
    quote a Rule the repo cannot read has not been helped by running.
    `rule_of` still prints "(no practice file for ...)" there, so a check
    binding this way owes its whole remedy in its own finding text, the
    way this one's does.

    `selects_on` is a tuple of path globs naming the files this check's
    verdict actually depends on. A commit touching any of them SELECTS this
    check for that run, the same way a practice's own `applies_to` globs
    already select a practice-backed one (`_scoped_tree_slugs`, tier 2).

    WHY IT EXISTS, and it is the hole `practice_backed=False` opened
    without anyone noticing. Tier 2 reads its globs off
    `practices/<slug>.md` -- and a check enforcing a property of the ENGINE
    has no practice file by design. So every one of those checks fell
    straight through to tier 3, the rotation, and could be reached ONLY by
    its turn coming up: no file you touched could ever summon it. Measured
    2026-09-22, on 18 of them at once.

    The cost, same day: a fix to `.claude/hooks/freshness-guard.sh` landed
    in that copy and not in the template every other repo installs.
    `dogfooded-hooks-match-template` exists for precisely that, was not in
    that commit's rotation slice, and stayed silent. It surfaced only
    because a session ran it by name on a hunch -- which is not a mechanism
    (practice: upstream-fix). One commit later and the drifted template
    would have shipped.

    An over-broad glob costs a little runtime; a missing one leaves the
    rotation exactly as it was. So this only ever ADDS selection, and
    getting it wrong is never how a check stops running.

    `advisory=True` is distinct from a practice's own frontmatter
    `severity:` field (precedent_resolve.py's `severity: blocking`, about
    which SOURCE wins when two levels disagree) -- this is about whether
    THIS enforced check's own findings fail the run. Not exposed as a CLI
    flag or a general mechanism: a check is advisory only when a specific,
    dated incident justifies it (see parallel-artifact-ledger's own
    comment, 2026-09-05), the same bar checkable-gets-checked sets for
    leaving a practice advisory-only in the first place.

    `advisory_term` says whether that is forever, and every advisory check
    must give one (`advisory-checks-declare-their-term` enforces it):

      {'term': 'permanent', 'why': '...'}
          the check flags something only a person can judge, so it warns
          and never stops work, by design;
      {'term': 'temporary', 'waiting_for': '...', 'owner': '...',
       'revisit': 'YYYY-MM-DD'}
          it should stop work one day, but switching that on now would
          break something nobody can fix yet. Past `revisit` it is
          reported until someone switches it on, moves the date with a
          reason, or makes it permanent -- it never switches itself, the
          same design as a practice's `expires:`.

    WHY (2026-10-05): frontmatter-field-order was made advisory on
    2026-09-26 "until the practice sets have taken the engine update", a
    condition written only in a docstring, with no date and no owner. A
    temporary advisory looked exactly like a permanent one, so nothing came
    back to it, and nothing in any update ran the fixer it waited for
    (spec/PRACTICE_STANDING_AND_RECHECK_PLAN.md, Part 1 step 3).

    `existence_only=True` marks a check that confirms a practice's own
    machinery exists and can never report that the practice went
    unfollowed. layered-practice-packs does not count such a check as a
    route to a session: the routing audit passed as reachable through one
    for a month while nothing ever prompted anyone to run it
    (gotcha-2026-10-05-a-practice-routed-only-by-its-own-files-is-never-
    shown-to-anyone).

    """Register one CHECKS entry per `tools/checks/check_*.py` script this
    repo's sources materialized into it (precedent_materialize.py writes
    them there from every declared source's own tools/checks/).

    WHY THIS EXISTS. Until this ran, nothing anywhere invoked those
    scripts. `precedent_materialize.py` copied them in, `precedent_land.py`
    refused to land a shared or individual practice without one, and
    `spec/PRIVATE_ENFORCEMENT_BRIEF.md` told a private set how to write
    them -- and then a consuming repo held fourteen real, tested check
    scripts (nine in precedent-shared-repo-maintenance, five in
    precedent-individual, as of 2026-09-06) that no command ever ran. The
    enforced channel was live for the universal catalogue and hollow for
    exactly the sources an adopting team writes for itself.

    The contract every one of those scripts already keeps, and this
    depends on: no arguments; `ROOT` derived from its own location
    (`<repo>/tools/checks/check_x.py` -> `<repo>`), so it audits the repo
    it was materialized INTO, not its source; exit 0 and print nothing
    when clean; exit 1 and print the finding when violated; exit 2 for
    "could not run" (reported SKIPPED, never PASS, per this module's own
    rule). Any other exit status is the script's own bug and is reported
    as ERROR, which is neither a pass nor a violation.

    The slug is taken from whichever practice's `checked_by` names the
    script, so a finding names the practice and prints its Rule like
    every other check here -- falling back to the filename only when no
    practice claims it (a hand-dropped orphan, which the consuming repo's
    own materialized-tree check is the thing that catches)."""

    it had not touched a word of, and then a one-word product rename did
    the same. Both times the only ways to clear the demand were to invent
    an incident or to leave the defect unfixed -- and a demand nobody can
    honestly satisfy is worse than no demand, because it teaches people to
    route around the check.

    Link targets are normalized away outright (a target is not prose), and
    what remains is measured by how much actually changed -- see the two
    thresholds above for why both an absolute and a relative one are
    needed. Guessing wrong in the lenient direction costs a missing Story
    on a practice that already had one; guessing wrong in the strict
    direction costs the credibility of the check, which is worse."""

    each of them red on that update with nothing BestPractice could do about
    it. The plan was to make it blocking once the sets had run the fixer --
    and nothing ever ran it, so it sat advisory with a condition nobody
    owned. On 2026-10-05 the sets were tidied (14, 7, 4 and 1 files, whole
    fields moved and nothing else) and the engine's commit hook now runs
    the fixer on staged practice files in every practice source, so the
    order is kept rather than checked after the fact. This is a hard check
    from then on (practice: upstream-fix;
    spec/PRACTICE_STANDING_AND_RECHECK_PLAN.md).

# Where the clause ENDS is the whole difficulty, and the first attempt got it
# wrong in both directions. It read
# `\bSource:\s*([^-]+?)\s*(?:--|—|\.|-->)`, which (a) could not cross a
# hyphen, so a real clause naming `business-modeling/doc-recipes/x.recipe.md`
# did not match AT ALL and the file was reported as carrying no `Source:`
# clause -- sending the reader to look for a clause sitting right there in the
# header -- and (b) terminated on any `.`, so even a hyphen-free
# `Source: docs/plain.md -- fine` captured `docs/plain` and was reported as a
# path that does not exist. Hyphenated paths are the common case in these
# repos, not the edge case, so the rule was close to unsatisfiable: both
# failure messages pointed at the wrong problem, and a session trying to
# COMPLY had no way to. Found 2026-09-11 from a consuming repo while adding a
# clause to a generated header.
#
# What actually ends a clause, and why each terminator is written the way it
# is:
#   `-->`        the end of the HTML comment. Matched with no whitespace
#                requirement, and FIRST, so it wins over the `--` inside it.
#   whitespace + `--`
#                this project's prose dash. The lookbehind is the fix for (a):
#                a hyphen inside a path is never preceded by whitespace, so
#                `doc-recipes/` reads as path and ` -- the recipe` reads as the
#                end of the clause.
#   `—`          an em dash never occurs in a path, so it needs no guard.
#   `.` + whitespace or end
#                a sentence-ending period. The lookahead is the fix for (b):
#                an extension's dot is always followed by its extension, never
#                by a space, so `.md ` no longer truncates. Dropping `.`
#                altogether was the alternative and is worse -- without it a
#                clause written as a sentence swallows the rest of the comment,
#                and every path-shaped token in that prose is then checked as
#                if the header had named it.
#   end of text  a clause with no terminator at all captures to the end rather
#                than failing to match, because "no `Source:` clause" is the
#                one message that must mean what it says.
#
# WHAT THE CLAUSE MAY NAME is the second question, and it was got wrong for
# a different reason (found 2026-09-12, from a consuming repo, on a file
# MIRRORED in from the repo that builds it). The grammar assumed the source
# is a path in the repo the header is sitting in. For a mirrored artifact
# that is never true, and the three wordings tried were wrong three
# different ways: no clause at all (correctly refused); the source's own
# in-repo paths, which do not exist in the mirror, so the check reported
# them as a Source that had MOVED -- by the practice's own reasoning a worse
# state than none; and a URL to the building repo, which reads correctly to
# a human and matches no path, so it was refused as naming nothing.
#
# So the clause takes an optional parenthetical naming the PLACE the source
# lives in, and that is the whole grammar addition:
#
#   Source: practices/                  -- in this repo. Every path must exist.
#   Source (in the Voice pack): voice/  -- somewhere else. Not resolvable here.
#
# The parenthetical is free text on purpose. Demanding a fixed phrase would
# reproduce the exact failure PR #246 fixed -- a near-miss reported as "no
# clause", sending a reader to hunt for something sitting in front of them --
# and the author is the one who knows what to call the place. What the check
# takes from it is one bit: this repository is not where the answer is.
#
# WHY NOT JUST ACCEPT A URL, which is the obvious move. Because the repo that
# builds a mirrored artifact is often PRIVATE, and both private-repo-scrub and
# precedent_materialize.py's _rewrite_links already refuse to mint a URL
# naming a private repo into content that ships -- "a relative link that does
# not resolve is a smaller failure than a disclosure that cannot be taken
# back". A check that made a URL the only way to comply would be pulling
# against that rule from the other side. The parenthetical takes a URL where
# naming it is fine and a plain label where it is not, so the leak gate stays
# the only thing deciding which -- this check never has an opinion about it.

    `precedent.json` declaring a source is a claim that its practices bind
    work here. Four channels can make good on that claim -- the resident
    block, the occasion index, a path trigger, and an enforced check (plus
    gates, which fire at a moment). A practice that none of them reaches is
    a rule nobody will ever be shown, in a repo that says it is in force:
    the config and the loader disagree, and the config is the one that
    reads as authoritative.

    Measured here on 2026-09-06: 30 of 114 practices in force in Precedent's
    own repo were reachable by nothing at all -- 27 from the shared source and
    3 from the individual one. Both are genuinely declared in
    `precedent.json` and in the user-level config; neither reaches
    `AGENTS.md`'s generated block, because `build_views.py` deliberately
    stays single-source here, and neither reaches the enforced channel,
    because `register_materialized_checks()` can only see scripts that were
    materialized -- and Precedent cannot materialize into itself.

    ADVISORY, deliberately, to the bar this module sets for that (see
    parallel-artifact-ledger's own note): the remedy is an architectural
    decision -- wire the sources into this repo's generated views, or state
    per practice that it does not bind here -- and running the same 15
    source checks against this tree showed the answer is not simply "turn
    them all on": five pass, four report real findings, and six report
    things this repo cannot act on because the practice is about a
    different kind of repository. Failing the gate would leave it red until
    somebody makes that call, and a permanently red gate is a gate nobody
    runs, which is this repo's own documented lesson.

    A source that does not RESOLVE in this environment is skipped, never
    reported -- a shared source is a sibling clone and an individual source
    resolves through a private user-level config, so neither exists in a
    bare CI checkout, and their absence there is not evidence of anything.

    neither the CI check nor its replacement.

    WHY THIS EXISTS (practice: cite-the-incident). The forward direction — a
    settings entry naming a file that is not there — is
    declared-hooks-exist above. This is the other end, and it was found in a
    real consuming repo: on 2026-09-14 an `Update Vendors` pass there found
    two hooks sitting in .claude/hooks/ with nothing naming them --
    freshness-guard.sh and commit-identity.sh, both written minutes earlier
    by precedent_refresh_sources.py --apply, which drops hook files in and
    deliberately will not edit a settings.json. Nothing failed, which is the
    whole problem: the session found them by listing the directory and
    reading settings.json against it, not because anything said so.

    TWO THINGS THIS INCIDENT IS NOT, corrected 2026-09-14 against the
    repo's own history after the first version of this docstring got both
    wrong (practice: no-invented-specifics -- a cited incident is a claim,
    and a rule argued from a false one cannot be judged). Neither orphan was
    the reply gate: that repo had never carried reply-gate.sh at all, tracked
    or untracked, so its replies were ungated by absence and this check would
    have reported nothing. And the exposure was minutes inside one session,
    not "as long as the files had been present" -- the same session wired
    both before it merged. The real cost is the one still worth citing: a
    tool that installs hook files but cannot wire them leaves orphans by
    design, and until this check nothing but a person reading the directory
    would ever say so.

    Reachability deliberately includes engine tools, not only settings.
    tools/precedent_resolve.py invokes
    .claude/hooks/precedent-individual-bootstrap.sh by path rather than
    through any settings entry, so a check that read settings alone would
    report this repo's own working bootstrap hook as dead — measured here
    before this check shipped, which is why the clause exists.

    DECLINING A HOOK IS A DECISION, and until 2026-09-14 there was no way
    to record one. A source declares its harness adapters and every
    consuming repo's sync writes them into .claude/hooks/; the sync will
    not edit that repo's settings.json, deliberately, so a repo that does
    not want a particular adapter has no way to end up wired. This check
    then reported a correct decision as an orphan, permanently, and the
    only way to clear it was to wire a hook the repo had decided against.
    Measured in a real consuming repo the same day: its AGENTS.md recorded
    declining freshness-guard.sh because its own bootstrap already fetches
    and fast-forwards, and prose is deliberately not searched here, so
    nothing could read it.

    So a repo may declare `declined_adapters` in its precedent.json, each
    entry a `path` and a `reason` — the same shape, and the same
    requirement, as `filename_separator_exempt` above. THE REASON IS WHAT
    SATISFIES IT. A decline with no reason is not a decision, it is a
    silenced check, and it is reported as one. Two further states are
    reported rather than silently accepted, because both mean the
    declaration has come loose from what is on disk: a decline naming a
    file that is not there (the adapter went, and the note outlived it),
    and a decline for a hook that something DOES call (the repo changed its
    mind and wired it, and the stale note now misdescribes the repo to the
    next reader)."""

    self-declared on purpose -- since nothing else here would say so, and
    it reaches an already-installed repo through the ordinary vendoring of
    tools/, unlike a fix to settings.json itself (vendor-update-runbook.md
    step 3: settings.json is never touched by an update).

    Deliberately narrow: it does not verify the hardcoded value against

    THE HISTORY. This check was written on 2026-09-21 to refuse every anchor
    and alias (gotcha-2026-09-21-github-actions-rejects-yaml-anchors-python-
    accepts), on the belief that GitHub rejects them. It had supported plain
    anchors and aliases since 2025-09-18 (GitHub changelog, "Actions: YAML
    anchors and non-public workflow templates"); the session that met the
    anchor expanded it before pushing, so the rejection was assumed, never
    observed. A very deep check found that on 2026-09-28 and narrowed this
    to the merge key, which that same changelog says is still unsupported.

    WHAT MAKES IT WORTH A CHECK RATHER THAN A NOTE. The failure is not a red
    run. GitHub refuses the file, so the workflow does not appear at all,
    and the branch reads as having no CI rather than broken CI. Every local
    verification this project teaches passes it.

    Detected through PyYAML's token stream -- a plain `<<` scalar in key

    line that duplicates a working channel is paid for every turn.

    THE BUG THIS REPLACES, 2026-09-22 (cite-the-incident). This check used to
    gate on SPOKEN_TRIGGER_RE -- occasion text shaped like "a person says" or
    "the message asks" -- on the theory that only a SPOKEN trigger can arrive
    before a gate fires. That is true of `Go merge` and false in general: a
    gates: ["reply"] practice whose occasion is a MOMENT ("creating a
    session, at creation") is exactly as mistimed as a spoken one, because
    the reply gate still only fires at the end of the turn, after the moment
    the occasion describes has already passed. `session-title-abbreviates-repo`
    (precedent-individual) and this repo's own `session-title-names-the-
    difference` both had this exact shape -- gates: ["reply"], no
    index_required -- and both were silently dropped from the occasion index
    for two days before anyone noticed session titles had stopped getting
    named correctly. Neither occasion is phrased as a spoken trigger, so the
    old regex never flagged either one.

    No regex generalizes past today's known phrasings -- the check's own
    prior version already said so about its blind spot, correctly, and then
    still shipped narrow. So the gate is now the actual risk condition
    itself: ANY practice with an `occasion:` and a non-empty `gates:` is
    exactly the shape build_views.index_is_redundant() can silently drop,
    whatever the occasion's words look like. `index_required: true` keeps
    the line; `false` is a person's recorded judgment that the gate really
    does arrive no later than the occasion does."""

    # the ladder in tools/precedent_time.py. precedent.json's
    # `fallback_timezone` is rung 5, the repository's own choice, and it

    Function-level, not file-level, and that took three attempts to get
    right -- each earlier version passed its own negative control, which is
    the only reason the weakness showed at all.

    v1 asked whether the FILE contained the literal `get('base_branch')`.
    Deleting the helper from doc_lint.py and renaming it left that literal
    in the dead body, and the control came back green: a check a file
    passes by containing the right *words*.

    v2 asked whether the file made a real declared-branch CALL anywhere,
    via AST. Same control, same green -- the dead helper's call was still a
    call.

    v3, here, asks the actual question: the function doing the inferring
    must itself read a declaration, or be called by a function that does.

    "Practice check" needs full_practice_audit.py, "Reduction pass" needs
    session_load_trend.py, "Three Things" needs todo_progress.py.

    NOBODY WAS GOING TO NOTICE. Every check in the suite passes in a repo
    where a command is silently inert: the practice file is well-formed,
    the vocabulary listing prints it, and the tool's absence only shows
    when a person says the word. This is the mechanism.

    WHY IT RUNS WHERE THE ENGINE IS AUTHORED. It compares practices/
    against ENGINE_FILES/CONSUMER_ENGINE_FILES, which exist only here. A
    consuming repo has the delivered result, not the lists, so its own copy
    declines rather than passing vacuously.

    `precedent-beta-v01` is unmerged, and has done since 2026-09-03.

    Measured on 2026-09-06, on a real checkout of that branch: SIX separate
    tools carried their own copy of the inference, and two were actively
    wrong. `doc_lint.default_branch()` returned the literal string 'HEAD'
    (origin/HEAD unset, origin/main absent from a single-branch clone), so
    `changed_md()` diffed against a ref that does not resolve and returned
    ZERO files -- the markdown gate passing by scanning nothing.
    `doc_html._link_base()` emitted `/blob/main/` for content that exists
    only on the beta branch: every generated link dead.

    The duplication is deliberate and stays -- doc_lint.py and doc_html.py
    are meant to be droppable into a host repo alone, and doc_html.py's own
    docstring says so. So this does not demand a shared import. It demands
    that each copy ask the declared question first. Without a check the
    next tool copies the nearest existing resolver, inherits the bug, and
    tests clean again: that is precisely how this reached six copies.

# WHERE DISCLOSURE COUNTS, and the three-way contradiction this settled
# (2026-09-10). The practice's Rule names one destination -- "for a
# dependent repo, that document is templates/GETTING_STARTED.md's
# administrator section". This check read a root GITHUB_ACTIONS.md and
# nothing else. And INSTALL.md §1 step 6's root-hygiene list names
# GITHUB_ACTIONS.md among the files that exist ONLY under
# `process/upstream/` and must never be copied to the root. So a dependent
# repo that FOLLOWED the practice failed the check, and one that satisfied
# the check tripped root hygiene -- unless it wrote its own,
# differently-scoped GITHUB_ACTIONS.md, which nothing asked it to. The
# check's own "blind to" text half-admitted it ("a README section would
# satisfy the practice's intent but not this check").
#
# Settled in the Rule's favour, because the Rule is the one of the three
# that carries the reasoning: the destination is "the document that
# project's own people actually read", and in a dependent repo that is
# GETTING_STARTED.md, which root hygiene explicitly DOES place at the root.
#
# Both are read, rather than swapping one hard-coded filename for another.
# A root GITHUB_ACTIONS.md stays a valid home for a repo that has its own --
# distinct from a vendored copy, which root hygiene still forbids at a
# dependent repo's root. BestPractice itself no longer IS that root case:
# its own copy moved to documentation/GITHUB_ACTIONS.md on 2026-09-20 (the
# same root-tidy pass that moved MOBILE.md and METHOD.md), so that path is
# read too -- a repo that discloses in any of the three has disclosed.

#
# ROOT-CAUSED 2026-09-06 -- and it was never a false positive. The finding
# was true of the tree CI was actually standing on. verify_harness.py (step
# 5) invoked a vendored `precedent_vendor_engine.py refresh <ROOT> --force`,
# and refresh() then ran `git checkout precedent-beta-v01` + `git pull` in
# the clone it was handed -- which in CI is the job's own workspace. So step
# 5 moved the workspace onto the base branch, and precedent_check.py (step 6)
# ran the BASE branch's tree, where templates/harness/LEDGER.md genuinely has
# no row for f2078d6. The same substitution explains every other symptom:
# the summary line CI printed was the base branch's own pre-advisory format,
# and the diagnostic prints never appeared because by step 6 the file was no
# longer the file they had been added to. `git status` stays clean throughout
# -- a branch checkout leaves no dirty file to notice -- which is why four
# independent content verifications all came back correct while the workspace
# stood on a different commit. Reproduced deterministically: run
# verify_harness.py and then precedent_check.py in one checkout and the
# second reports this violation; run precedent_check.py alone on the same
# commit and it is clean. Fixed upstream in 25546bc (refresh() materializes
# blobs and never checks the clone out, with a regression case that fails
# against the pre-fix engine) and here by vendoring from a throwaway clone.
# Full account:
# https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/pull/110#issuecomment-5556343855
#
# So this check is ENFORCING again, as originally written: there was no
# platform mystery, and nothing left to except it from. The lesson worth
# keeping is diagnostic -- when a check's finding contradicts the tree you
# believe you are on, confirm WHICH COMMIT is actually checked out before
# concluding the check is wrong. Four rounds of content verification cannot
# distinguish a wrong answer from a right answer about a different tree.

    """{slug: reason} for the practices this repo declared `not_binding`
    and that may actually be exempted, plus the slugs whose exemption is
    REFUSED because the practice is `severity: blocking`.

    WHY THIS EXISTS, and what was broken without it (2026-09-10).
    precedent_resolve.load_not_binding()'s own docstring describes the
    mechanism exactly -- "whether a rule binds is a property of the PAIR,
    not of the rule: `commit-author` binds a repo one person authors alone
    and not one with many contributors" -- and this module read that list
    in exactly ONE place, `_unreachable_practices`, where it only ever
    suppressed a REACHABILITY finding. `main()` built its slug list from
    `sorted(CHECKS)` and never consulted it at all, so declaring
    `{"slug": "commit-author", "reason": "..."}` in a consuming repo's
    precedent.json changed nothing about the run: the practice was still
    checked, still violated, still counted, still exit 1. There was NO WAY
    for a consuming repo to declare a practice non-binding and get a clean
    check, and a real install ended on two permanent violations it had
    written reasoned exemptions for. The 17 entries in
    templates/document-project/precedent.json were, for check
    purposes, decorative.

    EXEMPTED IS ITS OWN STATUS, never silence. Dropping these slugs from
    the run would trade one problem for a worse one -- an exemption that
    leaves no trace in the output is how a rule gets switched off and
    forgotten. They are reported by name, with their recorded reasons, and
    counted in their own summary category.

    `severity: blocking` may not be exempted, the same rule
    _unreachable_practices already applies, for the same reason: a
    blocking practice is exactly the one no downstream declaration is
    allowed to switch off. A refused exemption runs normally here; the
    reachability check is what reports the refusal itself as a finding, so
    it is stated once rather than twice."""

# nothing -- and it was the one nobody could find without reading everything.

    """-> the subset of `tree_slugs` (all `scope: 'tree'` CHECKS keys) to
    actually run this invocation, per Morgan's 2026-09-18 direction: don't
    sweep every tree-scope check every time, but never leave one uncovered
    for long. Three tiers, unioned:

      1. DIRECTLY touched -- this commit's diff includes the check's own
         `practices/<slug>.md`.
      2. LIKELY INDIRECTLY touched -- the diff includes a file matching
         one of the practice's own `applies_to` globs (narrower than
         `**`; a practice whose only glob is `**` can never be "indirectly"
         matched by a specific file, so it always falls to tier 3).
      3. A ROTATING slice of whatever's left, keyed by `git rev-list
         --count HEAD` mod ROTATION_BUCKETS -- deterministic, not random,
         so ROTATION_BUCKETS consecutive commits cover the whole remaining
         set exactly once each, not "probably."

    `buckets` is normally left as `None`, which selects the single current
    bucket (`commit_count % ROTATION_BUCKETS`) exactly as before. Passing
    an explicit set of bucket indices instead selects the UNION of those
    buckets' slices -- the knob `_run_with_coverage_retry` turns when the
    single current bucket comes back covering nothing (see its docstring
    for why a single bucket can do that on a small catalogue).

    Retired/deduplicated practices are never scheduled at all (tier 3
    would otherwise round-robin dead checks). A slug with no resolvable
    practices/<slug>.md here (this repo doesn't carry that practice) is
    passed through unfiltered -- run()'s own gate reports the ordinary
    SKIPPED reason for it, cheaply, before this scoping would matter."""

    --only, not --full-sweep/--all) selection path, widening the tree-scope
    rotation slice when the first slice selected turns out to cover nothing.

    Why this exists (practice: cite-the-incident). `_scoped_tree_slugs`'s
    rotation guarantees coverage of the WHOLE tree-scope catalogue across
    ROTATION_BUCKETS commits, but says nothing about any SINGLE commit --
    a repo whose practice catalogue is small relative to the full CHECKS
    registry (a source set, not BestPractice itself, where most checks bind
    a practice the set does not carry) can land on a bucket where every
    slug the rotation slice picked, and every always-run non-tree check
    besides, is inapplicable there. Measured 2026-09-20 against two real
    PRs: precedent-shared-repo-maintenance PR #102 (commit count 253,
    bucket 3) and precedent-shared-writing PR #57 (commit count 146,
    bucket 6) both reported `0 passed` under the plain default selection,
    on commits with real, passing coverage elsewhere in the same
    catalogue -- `--full-sweep` against the identical trees found 19 and 17
    passing checks respectively. Checked out each repo's pre-change `main`
    tip too, with the identical zero-passed result, which rules out either
    PR's own diff as the cause: this is a property of how the rotation
    interacts with a sparse catalogue, not something either PR introduced.

    The CI backstop ("Refuse a run that checked nothing") did exactly its
    job given what it was handed -- it saw a summary line with `0 passed`
    and correctly refused it. The gap is upstream of the backstop, in what
    got selected to run in the first place, so the fix belongs here rather
    than in the backstop's bash (fixing it there would only help that one
    caller; every other caller of this module still gets the false alarm).

    One additional bucket is folded in at a time -- never straight to
    --full-sweep -- so a repo that is genuinely covered by its second
    bucket still only pays for two slices, not the whole tree. If every
    bucket has been folded in and the run STILL reports nothing but SKIPPED
    and EXEMPT, that is no longer an unlucky rotation number; it is a
    catalogue with nothing checkable at all, and main()'s own `0 passed`
    refusal is the correct, loud outcome -- this function must not paper
    over that by looping forever or manufacturing a result."""
