"""precedent_check.py — the ENFORCED loading channel, made real (phase 4).

PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md, "How an Agent Knows Which Practices to Load", names
four channels. Three were built in phase 2 and 3; this is the fourth:

    **Enforced.** Practices with `checked_by` are never loaded at all. The
    check's failure message *is* the rule, delivered at the moment of
    violation.

Before this existed, `checked_by:` was a *claim*: a string naming a script
that existed. The harness verified the file was there and nothing else, so
eight practices reported enforcement that nobody had ever seen fire. Tested
one by one at the start of phase 4, the eight came apart:
`readers-vocabulary` named a linter with no vocabulary check in it at all;
`acronyms-glossary` named a check that only ever warns; the two practices
naming `doc_sync.py` and the two naming `practice_audit.py` named gates that
were RED on this repository, for reasons that had nothing to do with either
practice. A claim nobody tested is worth less than no claim, because it
reads as coverage.

So this module is deliberately not "a script that checks practices". It is a
registry with one entry per enforced practice, and every entry owes two
things:

  * **a failure message that IS the rule.** On a violation the practice's
    own `## Rule` is printed, read through the same code path every other
    channel uses (`split_practices._read_practice_file`, via
    `precedent_show`'s reader) — never a paraphrase that can drift from it.
  * **a test that proves it fires.** tools/verify_harness.py plants a real
    violation for every registered slug in a throwaway repository and
    asserts the exit status, then asserts the unplanted baseline is clean.
    A slug registered here without a case there fails the harness.

A CHECK THAT CANNOT RUN REPORTS THAT IT DID NOT RUN. Every graceful-failure
path here ends in SKIPPED with a reason, never in a pass. This repository
has been bitten four times by the opposite -- a scan with an empty input set
printing OK -- and the whole point of an enforced practice is that its check
is the only thing standing where the prose used to be.

A RULE THIS REPO HAS SAID DOES NOT BIND IT REPORTS **EXEMPT**, and reports
it by name with the recorded reason. `not_binding` in precedent.json is
where a consuming repo declares that a pair -- this repo, this rule -- has
no relationship (precedent_resolve.load_not_binding). Until 2026-09-10 that
declaration did nothing to this module's run: only the reachability check
read it, so an exempted practice was still checked, still violated, still
counted, and there was no way for a consuming repo to declare a practice
non-binding and get a clean check. `severity: blocking` still cannot be
exempted. See load_exemptions().

"THE CHECK RAN" AND "THE PRACTICE IS IN FORCE" ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS,
and this module treats them as one. Said plainly because the difference is
invisible from the output, and a session has been misled by it:

  the check ran         a practices/<slug>.md file EXISTS -- at any status
                        -- or the check carries binds_publishers and this
                        repo publishes practices. That is the whole of
                        run()'s gate: `_practice_file(slug) is None`, which
                        looks for the file and reads nothing inside it.
  the practice is in    the file exists AND its frontmatter `status` is in
  force                 force. A file at `deduplicated` or `retired` is not
                        in force, is excluded from every generated view,
                        and STILL SWITCHES ITS CHECK ON.

LEFT THAT WAY DELIBERATELY, decided 2026-09-13. Enforcing a withdrawn
practice is harmless -- the rule is either in force one level up
(`deduplicated`) or nobody wants it anywhere (`retired`, rare and loud), and
in neither case does running the check make something wrong happen.
binds_publishers now covers the cases that motivated the question. Changing
the gate to read `status` would be a behaviour change nobody asked for, in
every consuming repo at once, and `rule_of()` needs the file to exist in
order to print anything at all.

THE CONSEQUENCE THAT COSTS SOMETHING, which is why this is written down
rather than shrugged at: **a session verifying that a local re-declaration is
no longer load-bearing cannot do it by deduplicating the file and seeing the
check still pass.** File presence alone produces that result, so the weak
test "confirms" the removal while proving nothing. The decisive test is
removing the file entirely. That is how a team set's re-declared
catalogue-carries-stories copy was actually verified on 2026-09-13; the
weaker test would have passed just as readily on a copy that was still the
only thing switching the check on.

Scopes, because a practice is not always a property of a file:

  tree      a property of the repository as it stands (an index exists, the
            generated views are current). Always runs.
  change    a property of what a change adds or edits (a new practice
            carries its incident). Runs against the files in scope.
  turn-end  a property of the state you wanted AFTER an operation (nothing
            unpushed, no published history rewritten). Excluded from the
            default run -- mid-work it is not a violation -- and run by
            --turn-end, which is where a Stop hook calls it.

Run:
  python3 tools/precedent_check.py                  # tree + change scopes
  python3 tools/precedent_check.py --turn-end       # the end-of-turn scope

                                                    # (implies --full-sweep)
  python3 tools/precedent_check.py --full-sweep     # every tree-scope check,
                                                    # not just this commit's
                                                    # touched + rotation slice
  python3 tools/precedent_check.py --list           # what is registered
  python3 tools/precedent_check.py --explain        # what each check does NOT check
  python3 tools/precedent_check.py --strict         # a SKIP, or a thing a

                                                    # is a failure

A bare run does NOT sweep every `tree`-scope check every time (Morgan,
2026-09-18): each run covers a check whose own practice file or a matching
applies_to path was touched this commit, plus a rotating 1/10th slice of
whatever's left, so a check skipped this commit is covered within 10
commits -- guaranteed by the commit count, never left to chance. See
_scoped_tree_slugs()'s own docstring for the exact rule. `change`-scope
checks are unaffected; they already self-limit to the diff, every run.

    `practice_backed=False` marks a check that enforces a property of the
    engine itself rather than a catalogue practice, so it has no
    `practices/<slug>.md` to be in force. Every other check is gated on
    its practice actually resolving in THIS repo (see `run()`): this file
    is vendored into consuming repos, and a check for a practice a
    consumer does not have is a finding it can never act on.

    `binds_publishers=True` marks a check whose subject is the practice
    FILES a repo publishes, so it binds any repo that publishes a
    practices/ tree even where that practice's own text is not vendored
    in. It exists because the gate below, correct for a consumer, is
    exactly wrong for a practice SOURCE set: a source set's practices/
    holds its own practices only, so every other level's check skips
    there -- permanently, since it resolves no sources and materializes
    nothing into itself. Measured 2026-09-12 in a team source: 12 checks
    passed and 42 SKIPPED, all 42 for that one reason. The cost was
    already paid once -- a practice file there shipped a relative link to
    a file materialization does not copy, live in the publishing set and
    dead in every repo that received the catalogue, and the rule that
    catches exactly that was one of the 42. A consuming repo found it, a
    sync late (practice: cite-the-incident).

    Set it only where the check's subject really is the published
    practice tree, and only where the check is known to FUNCTION in a

# Where the clause ENDS is the whole difficulty, and the first attempt got it
# wrong in both directions. It read
# `\bSource:\s*([^-]+?)\s*(?:--|—|\.|-->)`, which (a) could not cross a
# hyphen, so a real clause naming `business-modeling/doc-recipes/x.recipe.md`
# did not match AT ALL and the file was reported as carrying no `Source:`
# clause -- sending the reader to look for a clause sitting right there in the
# header -- and (b) terminated on any `.`, so even a hyphen-free
# `Source: docs/plain.md -- fine` captured `docs/plain` and was reported as a
# path that does not exist. Hyphenated paths are the common case in these
# repos, not the edge case, so the rule was close to unsatisfiable: both
# failure messages pointed at the wrong problem, and a session trying to
# COMPLY had no way to. Found 2026-09-11 from a consuming repo while adding a
# clause to a generated header.
#
# What actually ends a clause, and why each terminator is written the way it
# is:
#   `-->`        the end of the HTML comment. Matched with no whitespace
#                requirement, and FIRST, so it wins over the `--` inside it.
#   whitespace + `--`
#                this project's prose dash. The lookbehind is the fix for (a):
#                a hyphen inside a path is never preceded by whitespace, so
#                `doc-recipes/` reads as path and ` -- the recipe` reads as the
#                end of the clause.
#   `—`          an em dash never occurs in a path, so it needs no guard.
#   `.` + whitespace or end
#                a sentence-ending period. The lookahead is the fix for (b):
#                an extension's dot is always followed by its extension, never
#                by a space, so `.md ` no longer truncates. Dropping `.`
#                altogether was the alternative and is worse -- without it a
#                clause written as a sentence swallows the rest of the comment,
#                and every path-shaped token in that prose is then checked as
#                if the header had named it.
#   end of text  a clause with no terminator at all captures to the end rather
#                than failing to match, because "no `Source:` clause" is the
#                one message that must mean what it says.
#
# WHAT THE CLAUSE MAY NAME is the second question, and it was got wrong for
# a different reason (found 2026-09-12, from a consuming repo, on a file
# MIRRORED in from the repo that builds it). The grammar assumed the source
# is a path in the repo the header is sitting in. For a mirrored artifact
# that is never true, and the three wordings tried were wrong three
# different ways: no clause at all (correctly refused); the source's own
# in-repo paths, which do not exist in the mirror, so the check reported
# them as a Source that had MOVED -- by the practice's own reasoning a worse
# state than none; and a URL to the building repo, which reads correctly to
# a human and matches no path, so it was refused as naming nothing.
#
# So the clause takes an optional parenthetical naming the PLACE the source
# lives in, and that is the whole grammar addition:
#
#   Source: practices/                  -- in this repo. Every path must exist.
#   Source (in the Voice pack): voice/  -- somewhere else. Not resolvable here.
#
# The parenthetical is free text on purpose. Demanding a fixed phrase would
# reproduce the exact failure PR #246 fixed -- a near-miss reported as "no
# clause", sending a reader to hunt for something sitting in front of them --
# and the author is the one who knows what to call the place. What the check
# takes from it is one bit: this repository is not where the answer is.
#
# WHY NOT JUST ACCEPT A URL, which is the obvious move. Because the repo that
# builds a mirrored artifact is often PRIVATE, and both private-repo-scrub and
# precedent_materialize.py's _rewrite_links already refuse to mint a URL
# naming a private repo into content that ships -- "a relative link that does
# not resolve is a smaller failure than a disclosure that cannot be taken
# back". A check that made a URL the only way to comply would be pulling
# against that rule from the other side. The parenthetical takes a URL where
# naming it is fine and a plain label where it is not, so the leak gate stays
# the only thing deciding which -- this check never has an opinion about it.

    consuming repos, where this whole tree -- evals/ included -- sits under a

    and the check reported 26 violations against these same recorded prompts
    at `<mirror>/evals/...` -- every one a false positive, and not one of them

    `precedent.json` declaring a source is a claim that its practices bind
    work here. Four channels can make good on that claim -- the resident
    block, the occasion index, a path trigger, and an enforced check (plus
    gates, which fire at a moment). A practice that none of them reaches is
    a rule nobody will ever be shown, in a repo that says it is in force:
    the config and the loader disagree, and the config is the one that
    reads as authoritative.

    Measured here on 2026-09-06: 30 of 114 practices in force in Precedent's
    own repo were reachable by nothing at all -- 27 from the team source and
    3 from the individual one. Both are genuinely declared in
    `precedent.json` and in the user-level config; neither reaches
    `AGENTS.md`'s generated block, because `build_views.py` deliberately
    stays single-source here, and neither reaches the enforced channel,
    because `register_materialized_checks()` can only see scripts that were
    materialized -- and Precedent cannot materialize into itself.

    ADVISORY, deliberately, to the bar this module sets for that (see
    parallel-artifact-ledger's own note): the remedy is an architectural
    decision -- wire the sources into this repo's generated views, or state
    per practice that it does not bind here -- and running the same 15
    source checks against this tree showed the answer is not simply "turn
    them all on": five pass, four report real findings, and six report
    things this repo cannot act on because the practice is about a
    different kind of repository. Failing the gate would leave it red until
    somebody makes that call, and a permanently red gate is a gate nobody
    runs, which is this repo's own documented lesson.

    A source that does not RESOLVE in this environment is skipped, never
    reported -- a team source is a sibling clone and an individual source
    resolves through a private user-level config, so neither exists in a
    bare CI checkout, and their absence there is not evidence of anything.

    WHY THIS EXISTS (practice: cite-the-incident). The forward direction — a
    settings entry naming a file that is not there — is
    declared-hooks-exist above. This is the other end, and it was found in a
    real consuming repo: on 2026-09-14 an `Update Vendors` pass there found
    two hooks sitting in .claude/hooks/ with nothing naming them --
    freshness-guard.sh and commit-identity.sh, both written minutes earlier
    by precedent_refresh_sources.py --apply, which drops hook files in and
    deliberately will not edit a settings.json. Nothing failed, which is the
    whole problem: the session found them by listing the directory and
    reading settings.json against it, not because anything said so.

    TWO THINGS THIS INCIDENT IS NOT, corrected 2026-09-14 against the
    repo's own history after the first version of this docstring got both
    wrong (practice: no-invented-specifics -- a cited incident is a claim,
    and a rule argued from a false one cannot be judged). Neither orphan was
    the reply gate: that repo had never carried reply-gate.sh at all, tracked
    or untracked, so its replies were ungated by absence and this check would
    have reported nothing. And the exposure was minutes inside one session,
    not "as long as the files had been present" -- the same session wired
    both before it merged. The real cost is the one still worth citing: a
    tool that installs hook files but cannot wire them leaves orphans by
    design, and until this check nothing but a person reading the directory
    would ever say so.

    Reachability deliberately includes engine tools, not only settings.
    tools/precedent_resolve.py invokes
    .claude/hooks/precedent-individual-bootstrap.sh by path rather than
    through any settings entry, so a check that read settings alone would
    report this repo's own working bootstrap hook as dead — measured here
    before this check shipped, which is why the clause exists.

    DECLINING A HOOK IS A DECISION, and until 2026-09-14 there was no way
    to record one. A source declares its harness adapters and every
    consuming repo's sync writes them into .claude/hooks/; the sync will
    not edit that repo's settings.json, deliberately, so a repo that does
    not want a particular adapter has no way to end up wired. This check
    then reported a correct decision as an orphan, permanently, and the
    only way to clear it was to wire a hook the repo had decided against.
    Measured in a real consuming repo the same day: its AGENTS.md recorded
    declining freshness-guard.sh because its own bootstrap already fetches
    and fast-forwards, and prose is deliberately not searched here, so
    nothing could read it.

    So a repo may declare `declined_adapters` in its precedent.json, each
    entry a `path` and a `reason` — the same shape, and the same
    requirement, as `filename_separator_exempt` above. THE REASON IS WHAT
    SATISFIES IT. A decline with no reason is not a decision, it is a
    silenced check, and it is reported as one. Two further states are
    reported rather than silently accepted, because both mean the
    declaration has come loose from what is on disk: a decline naming a
    file that is not there (the adapter went, and the note outlived it),
    and a decline for a hook that something DOES call (the repo changed its
    mind and wired it, and the stale note now misdescribes the repo to the
    next reader)."""

    # ---- the ENGINE's fallback zone, in the three engine files that hold it

    # precedent.json IS NOT IN THIS SET, and putting it here was a real bug
    # (found 2026-09-14 by the first real §0 install into a project with
    # subject matter of its own). The comment this replaces said "the three
    # files that hold it" while the code compared FOUR holders, and the
    # fourth is not a copy of the other three -- it is a different RUNG of
    # the ladder in tools/precedent_time.py. precedent.json's
    # `fallback_timezone` is rung 5, the repository's own choice, and it
    # EXISTS to override rung 6, the engine constant below: precedent_time's
    # own header says "rung 5 lets any repo say otherwise", declared where
    # "an adopting repo can set its own without editing vendored code".
    # Both consumers honour that at runtime -- precedent_time._repo_fallback_zone
    # and commit-identity.sh's _repo_fallback_tz, which falls back to
    # DEFAULT_TZ only when precedent.json names nothing.
    #
    # So an adopter declaring America/Argentina/Buenos_Aires in precedent.json,
    # with the engine files untouched at America/New_York, behaves correctly
    # and used to fail this check. Reproduced in a private consumer before
    # this was changed.

    # What IS a lockstep, and stays one: the three ENGINE holders, so the
    # engine never reports a zone it is not applying.

    Function-level, not file-level, and that took three attempts to get
    right -- each earlier version passed its own negative control, which is
    the only reason the weakness showed at all.

    v1 asked whether the FILE contained the literal `get('base_branch')`.
    Deleting the helper from doc_lint.py and renaming it left that literal
    in the dead body, and the control came back green: a check a file
    passes by containing the right *words*.

    v2 asked whether the file made a real declared-branch CALL anywhere,
    via AST. Same control, same green -- the dead helper's call was still a
    call.

    v3, here, asks the actual question: the function doing the inferring
    must itself read a declaration, or be called by a function that does.
    The one-hop allowance is not slack; it is checkin.py's real shape,
    where `_tracked_branch()` reads the manifest's `upstream.branch` and
    delegates to `_default_branch(clone)` only as the fallback. Requiring
    the read inside the leaf would have flagged the one resolver in this
    tree that was already correct.

    ZERO files -- the markdown gate passing by scanning nothing.

# dependent repo, that document is templates/GETTING_STARTED.md's
# administrator section". This check read a root GITHUB_ACTIONS.md and
# nothing else. And INSTALL.md §1 step 6's root-hygiene list names
# GITHUB_ACTIONS.md among the files that exist ONLY under
# `process/upstream/` and must never be copied to the root. So a dependent
# repo that FOLLOWED the practice failed the check, and one that satisfied
# the check tripped root hygiene -- unless it wrote its own,
# differently-scoped GITHUB_ACTIONS.md, which nothing asked it to. The
# check's own "blind to" text half-admitted it ("a README section would
# satisfy the practice's intent but not this check").
#
# Settled in the Rule's favour, because the Rule is the one of the three
# that carries the reasoning: the destination is "the document that
# project's own people actually read", and in a dependent repo that is
# GETTING_STARTED.md, which root hygiene explicitly DOES place at the root.
#
# Both are read, rather than swapping one hard-coded filename for another.
# A root GITHUB_ACTIONS.md stays a valid home for a repo that has its own --
# distinct from a vendored copy, which root hygiene still forbids at a
# dependent repo's root. BestPractice itself no longer IS that root case:
# its own copy moved to documentation/GITHUB_ACTIONS.md on 2026-09-20 (the
# same root-tidy pass that moved MOBILE.md and METHOD.md), so that path is
# read too -- a repo that discloses in any of the three has disclosed.

# cite-the-incident, 2026-09-05: this check was wired into CI the same day
# it was written (deep-check.yml) and immediately found a real, pre-existing
# gap -- templates/harness/LEDGER.md was missing a row for f2078d6, the
# commit that created the claude-code/codex/gemini-cli family in the first
# place, five weeks before the ledger file existed. That gap is fixed
# (backfilled in dfe504d). Two more, separately real fixes followed:
# b16b141 made the root/inception exemption above shallow-clone-safe (reads
# .git/shallow directly, since `git rev-list --max-parents=0` can't be
# trusted on a shallow checkout -- see this file's AGENTS.md for the
# general gotcha), and 2a0fbe0 added `fetch-depth: 0` to deep-check.yml's
# checkout (a real, repo-wide gap independent of this check).
#
# ROOT-CAUSED 2026-09-06 -- and it was never a false positive. The finding
# was true of the tree CI was actually standing on. verify_harness.py (step
# 5) invoked a vendored `precedent_vendor_engine.py refresh <ROOT> --force`,
# and refresh() then ran `git checkout precedent-beta-v01` + `git pull` in
# the clone it was handed -- which in CI is the job's own workspace. So step
# 5 moved the workspace onto the base branch, and precedent_check.py (step 6)
# ran the BASE branch's tree, where templates/harness/LEDGER.md genuinely has
# no row for f2078d6. The same substitution explains every other symptom:
# the summary line CI printed was the base branch's own pre-advisory format,
# and the diagnostic prints never appeared because by step 6 the file was no
# longer the file they had been added to. `git status` stays clean throughout
# -- a branch checkout leaves no dirty file to notice -- which is why four
# independent content verifications all came back correct while the workspace
# stood on a different commit. Reproduced deterministically: run
# verify_harness.py and then precedent_check.py in one checkout and the
# second reports this violation; run precedent_check.py alone on the same
# commit and it is clean. Fixed upstream in 25546bc (refresh() materializes
# blobs and never checks the clone out, with a regression case that fails
# against the pre-fix engine) and here by vendoring from a throwaway clone.
# Full account:
# https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice/pull/110#issuecomment-5556343855
#
# So this check is ENFORCING again, as originally written: there was no
# platform mystery, and nothing left to except it from. The lesson worth
# keeping is diagnostic -- when a check's finding contradicts the tree you
# believe you are on, confirm WHICH COMMIT is actually checked out before
# concluding the check is wrong. Four rounds of content verification cannot
# distinguish a wrong answer from a right answer about a different tree.

    """{slug: reason} for the practices this repo declared `not_binding`
    and that may actually be exempted, plus the slugs whose exemption is
    REFUSED because the practice is `severity: blocking`.

    WHY THIS EXISTS, and what was broken without it (2026-09-10).
    precedent_resolve.load_not_binding()'s own docstring describes the
    mechanism exactly -- "whether a rule binds is a property of the PAIR,
    not of the rule: `commit-author` binds a repo one person authors alone
    and not one with many contributors" -- and this module read that list
    in exactly ONE place, `_unreachable_practices`, where it only ever
    suppressed a REACHABILITY finding. `main()` built its slug list from
    `sorted(CHECKS)` and never consulted it at all, so declaring
    `{"slug": "commit-author", "reason": "..."}` in a consuming repo's
    precedent.json changed nothing about the run: the practice was still
    checked, still violated, still counted, still exit 1. There was NO WAY
    for a consuming repo to declare a practice non-binding and get a clean
    check, and a real install ended on two permanent violations it had
    written reasoned exemptions for. The 17 entries in
    templates/document-project/precedent.json were, for check
    purposes, decorative.

    EXEMPTED IS ITS OWN STATUS, never silence. Dropping these slugs from
    the run would trade one problem for a worse one -- an exemption that
    leaves no trace in the output is how a rule gets switched off and
    forgotten. They are reported by name, with their recorded reasons, and
    counted in their own summary category.

    `severity: blocking` may not be exempted, the same rule
    _unreachable_practices already applies, for the same reason: a
    blocking practice is exactly the one no downstream declaration is
    allowed to switch off. A refused exemption runs normally here; the
    reachability check is what reports the refusal itself as a finding, so
    it is stated once rather than twice."""

# nothing -- and it was the one nobody could find without reading everything.
