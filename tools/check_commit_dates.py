"""Each commit carries the declared person's time zone (practice buenos-aires-dates)

The engine's one copy of this check, for every kind of repository.

Its rule, buenos-aires-dates, lives in a person's own practice set, not in the
universal catalogue, so it is named here without a citation: engine code
cites only the catalogue it ships with (code-cites-practice).
precedent_push_check.IDENTITY_SLUGS and the practice's checked_by tie the
two together.

ONE COPY, SHIPPED BY THE ENGINE (Morgan, 2026-10-10: "yes ... build the
shared check"). This file and its twin, check_commit_author.py, live in tools/ as engine
files, so every repository runs the same copy: BestPractice, every practice
set and every consumer. Until that day the practice's own set (the person's
individual set) shipped a copy in tools/checks/, which every consumer
materialized, while BestPractice kept a port of its own. The two drifted:
the set's copies lacked the bot-author warning, PRECEDENT_CHECK_RANGE and
the skip of commits GitHub makes, and a consumer's merge gate refused every
GitHub-button merge for it. Nothing personal is written here: the zone and
the author come from the declared identity, and a repository's own
exemptions from its identity.json or precedent.json.

Scope: tree. Covers only the mechanically checkable half of the practice:
the git-commit mechanism. `git` records each commit's author-date UTC
offset verbatim from the environment's `TZ` at commit time, so a commit
made under `TZ="America/Argentina/Buenos_Aires"` always carries a fixed
"-0300" offset (Argentina has held UTC-3 with no DST since 2009 -- see the
practice's own Detail section). Every commit reachable from HEAD must carry
that offset.

The prose-date mechanism ("a doc's as-of note uses the Buenos Aires
calendar date on the day the text was written") has no mechanical
signature: nothing in the repo lets a check independently know what the
actual Buenos Aires wall-clock date was at write time, so it cannot be
verified here. See the practice file's own Install section for this split.

Exit 0 and print nothing when clean. Exit 1 and print the practice's own
Rule text (never a paraphrase) plus the specific finding(s) on a violation.
Exit 2, printing SKIPPED and a reason, when the check could not run at all
-- no identity is declared anywhere reachable (a shared repo, the expected
state there and not a defect), or the engine module is absent. That is
precedent_check.py's own convention for a source-supplied script, and its
runner turns exit 2 into SKIPPED rather than into a pass.

# TWO different questions, which used to share one name -- and that is exactly

# They are the same directory in both normal cases: run in place inside its own
# set, and materialized into a consuming repo (where precedent_materialize.py
# has written practices/ and tools/checks/ side by side). They differ in the
# third case -- a repo that DECLARES this source but never materializes it, and
# runs the script in place against itself. Precedent's own repo is exactly
# that: its practices/ is the universal catalogue, so `parents[2]/practices/`
# resolved to a directory this practice was never in, and rule_text() raised
# FileNotFoundError from inside the violation printer (2026-09-06). The rule
# text always ships beside the script, so it is looked up against SOURCE_ROOT
# and can no longer be absent; only what to audit is overridable.

# declaration apart from an absent one in _resolve().
IDENTITY_FILE = ROOT / "identity.json"

# THE TIMEZONE IS NOT WRITTEN HERE. It comes from the DECLARED IDENTITY --
# the person this repo resolves, whose zone is a person-level fact
# (practice: registry-source-of-truth) -- and the offset is computed from
# it. That makes this file generic: materialized into anybody's repo, it
# checks the commits there against whichever person that repo can resolve.
#
# The offset is computed for NOW, and compared against every commit in
# history. For this repo's declared zone that is exact -- Argentina has held
# UTC-3 with no daylight saving since 2009, which is what made a hardcoded
# "-0300" defensible before this. A zone that DOES observe daylight saving
# would make this check wrong for half the year, and the honest fix there is
# per-commit resolution rather than one offset; said out loud here rather
# than discovered by whoever adopts this file next.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE DECLARED IDENTITY IS THE ENGINE'S ANSWER, NOT THIS SCRIPT'S (2026-09-10)
#
# This check used to read `identity.json` at ROOT itself and report a
# VIOLATION when it was absent. But an identity.json at a repo's root MEANS
# "this repository is somebody's individual practice source" -- it is step 2
# of commit-identity.sh's own resolution order -- so a SHARED consuming repo
# must not have one, which is exactly what the per-repo grandfathering
# comment in check_commit_author.py already said at length. The two
# statements together left this check permanently red in every shared
# consuming repo, with the fix forbidden by the same file that demanded it.
# Found 2026-09-10 installing precedent-beta-v01 into a real private project
# via INSTALL.md section 0: the install ended on exactly these two checks,
# and writing reasoned `not_binding` exemptions for them did not help either.
#
# precedent_identity.declared_identity() answers it now, looking where
# commit-identity.sh looks and in the same order -- a PRECEDENT_COMMIT_*
# override, this repo's own identity.json, the individual source named by the
# user-level config -- and raising NoDeclaredIdentity when none of the three
# does. That is this check's cue to STAND DOWN, never to report a violation:
# a violation here must mean "a commit has the wrong author", not "this
# repository is shared". It deliberately stops there rather than falling
# through to the session owner, the authenticated GitHub account or an
# existing git config, the way commit-identity.sh continues to for AUTHORING
# a commit: those are inferences about an environment, and a check that
# judged a commit against the ambient git config would pass whatever it found.
#
# WHICH MODULE, 2026-09-10 (same day, second revision): the resolution
# moved upstream out of precedent_resolve.py into precedent_identity.py,
# which is in ENGINE_FILES rather than CONSUMER_ENGINE_FILES, so a practice
# SET vendors it too -- see _identity_module() below for why that matters and
# why the resolver is still tried second. mirrored_prefixes() stayed in the
# resolver, so the other checks here that use it are unaffected.
#
# THIS BLOCK IS DUPLICATED, verbatim, in the other identity check
# (check_commit_author.py), and that is forced rather than sloppy:
# precedent_materialize.py
# copies only the `check_*.py` scripts a practice's `checked_by:` claims, so
# a shared helper module beside them would never travel into a consuming
# repo. rule_text() is duplicated across all eight checks here for the same
# reason.

    `precedent_identity` FIRST, `precedent_resolve` second, and the order is

    out of it the same day (upstream 2026-09-10): the resolver is in
    precedent_vendor_engine.py's CONSUMER_ENGINE_FILES and deliberately NOT
    in its ENGINE_FILES, because a practice SET resolves no catalogue -- so a
    set does not vendor it, and these two checks went from enforcing to
    SKIPPED inside the very set they belong to, which is not a state anyone
    wanted. Identity is a question about a PERSON, and a practice set is the
    one repository that most certainly has one: an `identity.json` at a
    repo's root is what declares "this repository is somebody's individual
    practice source". So the resolution now lives in `precedent_identity.py`,
    which IS in ENGINE_FILES and reaches every kind of repo the engine
    reaches.

    The resolver keeps re-exporting both names, so the fallback below is for
    a CONSUMING repo whose vendored engine predates the split -- a
    compatibility path, never a preference. Anything in these sets that needs
    an identity imports `precedent_identity`; the resolver answers questions
    about a catalogue.

    Two install layouts, both real: INSTALL.md section 0 puts the engine at
    `<repo>/tools/`, and the classic section 1 vendoring puts it at
