"""parse_check.py -- does every machine-readable file in scope still parse?

ONE validator, TWO scopes, because the two checks it serves answer
different questions:

  deep check (tools/verify_harness.py) -- the files this change TOUCHED.
      It gates a push, runs constantly, and its job is "did I just break
      something", not "is the whole repo well".
  very deep check (tools/very_deep_check.py) -- every tracked file.
      On-demand, whole-repo, and the only place a file nobody has touched
      in months gets looked at again.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Nothing here parsed a YAML or JSON file at all until
2026-09-06 -- not .github/workflows/deep-check.yml, the file that RUNS the
deep check in CI, and not precedent.json, MANIFEST.json,
ENGINE_MANIFEST.json or routing_scope.json, each of which is read by
exactly one tool that would report its own confusing failure rather than
"this file is malformed". A broken workflow is the worst of these: GitHub
skips it silently, so the gate stops running and every push looks as green
as the day before.

The general question is "does anything validate this file type at all",
and it is worth asking of every format a repo commits, not just these two.
JSON and YAML are what this repo actually has.

affordance-is-shared: consuming repos get equivalent coverage on changed
files from the team set's own light check, so this is not vendored. If a
consumer ever wants the whole-tree sweep, this is the module to vendor.
