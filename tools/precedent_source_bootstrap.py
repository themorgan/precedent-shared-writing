"""precedent_source_bootstrap.py — the retry-capable half of getting a
privately-scoped individual practice source resolvable on an ephemeral,
hosted session (INSTALL.md step 9's individual-source branch;
spec/BOOTSTRAP_NEW_SOURCES.md).

THE INCIDENT THIS CLOSES, AND A CORRECTION ON HOW (2026-09-06). Two
independent adopters hit the same failure within a day of each other: a
`SessionStart` hook clones the person's individual-set repo and writes
`~/.config/precedent/config.json` — but that clone needs the session to
already have git read access to a private repo, and on this harness that
access is granted by the AGENT calling `add_repo` as its own first tool
call, in its own turn. A `SessionStart` hook runs *entirely to completion*
before that turn starts (Claude Code's own docs for this hook: synchronous
mode "guarantees dependencies are installed before your session starts" —
a strict ordering, not a race with variable odds). INSTALL.md used to say
a *behavioral instruction* ("tell the agent to call add_repo first") closed
this gap; both incidents are direct evidence it does not.

**This file originally shipped with a bounded retry in the hook itself
("Option B") as half the fix. A follow-up testing session proved that
wrong, structurally, not just unlucky: every retry attempt this file makes
runs *inside* the `SessionStart` hook's own execution, which by
construction finishes before the agent's turn — and therefore before
`add_repo` — can start even once. There is no point during this file's
own retry loop where `add_repo` access could possibly have appeared, on a
genuinely fresh session, no matter the attempt count or delay.** Retrying
here is not a partial mitigation of the incident; it is inert for it,
full stop, and previously cost every cold session real latency (up to
~12 seconds) for zero benefit on the exact path it was meant to help.

**The only thing that actually closes the gap is
`tools/precedent_resolve.py`'s own lazy self-heal ("Option A"):** it
re-invokes this same hook lazily, on demand, the first time anything
performs a live resolve and finds the config still absent — and because
that call happens *inside* the agent's own turn, always after `add_repo`
has already run (per the standing session-start instruction), the
re-invoked hook now has the access it needed and succeeds on its first
attempt. `DEFAULT_RETRIES` below reflects this: it defaults to a single
attempt, because a retry loop earns no credit here. `--retries`/
`--retry-delay` remain real, working options — not because they help with
`add_repo`, but as ordinary defensive engineering against a genuinely
transient git/network hiccup unrelated to this specific race, for a
caller who wants that and knows why.

WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE, VENDORED, HARNESS-NEUTRAL TOOL AND NOT INLINE SHELL
(practice: engine-plus-host-shims). The actual clone-or-pull-then-write-
config mechanism is domain-neutral: every adopter's version of it differs
only in the repo URL and two paths. Before this file existed, every adopter
hand-wrote their own copy of that mechanism directly in a shell hook script
(spec/MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md step 4's "worked pattern"), which is
exactly how a missing fix (first the retry that didn't exist, then the
retry that couldn't have worked) went unnoticed in more than one place at
once: a bug in hand-copied shell has to be found and fixed once per
adopter. Vendoring the mechanism here means a fix reaches every adopter
through their ordinary `process/upstream/` sync, and the per-adopter shell
hook
(templates/harness/claude-code/hooks/individual-source-bootstrap.sh.template)
shrinks to naming its own repo URL and two paths, then delegating.

Run:
  python3 precedent_source_bootstrap.py \\
      --level individual --name NAME --repo-url URL \\
      --clone PATH --config PATH \\
      [--branch NAME] [--retries N] [--retry-delay SECONDS] [--remote-only true]

Exit: always 0 (fail-gracefully — an unreachable individual source degrades
the session, per tools/precedent_resolve.py's own documented contract; it
must never be what takes a session down). A failure after every retry is
attempted is reported on stderr, not silently absorbed.

# WHICH BRANCH A SOURCE IS CLONED FROM, AND WHY IT IS NAMED HERE RATHER THAN
# ASKED FOR (practice: cite-the-incident).
#
# `git clone <url> <dir>` with no --branch asks the SERVER which branch to
# check out, and the server answers with its HEAD symref -- which is whatever
# is set in the repository's web settings. So the branch a session works on
# was decided by a setting on a web page that nothing in this repository can
# see, check, or version.
#
# 2026-09-09, measured from a consuming repo: two practice-source repositories
# had their default pointed at a feature branch, so every session-start clone
# of those sources landed on an older tree. `precedent_sync_views.py --check`
# then reported the CONSUMER as drifted, and a plain sync would have written
# that older text over newer committed text -- deleting a practice's Story
# block and a clause from its Rule, with no warning and exit 0. The consuming
# repo had never been stale; the clone had been pointed somewhere else.
#
# This repository already forbids the explicit form of that inference:
# precedent_check.py's `declared-base-branch` fails any tool that resolves
# refs/remotes/origin/HEAD without reading a DECLARED branch first, because
# origin/HEAD answers "what does the host show first" and every caller here
# means "what lineage does this work belong to". That check reads Python, so
# it never saw this one -- here git was making the same inference implicitly,
# on our behalf, inside a clone.
#
# `main` is the convention for a practice-set source and the fallback, never
# an assumption to make when the repository says otherwise: a source that
# declares base_branch in its own precedent.json is taken at its word, which
# is what expected_branch() below is for.

    WHY THE PERSIST LIVES HERE AND NOT IN run_sync (practice: cite-the-incident).
    It used to sit in run_sync, on the reasoning that every sync goes through
    there. Two do not, and between them they cover every clone a session
    actually meets at startup:

      * teams_from_repo's ALREADY-ON-DISK branch calls this function
        directly, so a team clone that exists -- which is every team clone
        after the first session -- was synced and never given a helper.
      * the individual source is not synced at session start at all while it
        looks usable: session-start.sh leaves it to precedent_resolve.py's
        self-heal, and a healthy clone never triggers one.

    So run_sync's comment calling itself "the repair path for the clones made
    before this existed" was true of a path those clones do not take.
    Measured 2026-09-11, hours after the persist landed: all four private
    sources on disk, PRECEDENT_GIT_TOKEN set, not one of them carrying a
    helper, and the freshness guard blocking every non-git tool call of the
    session exactly as it had before the fix. This function is the one funnel
    both a clone and a pull pass through, so it is where the guarantee holds.

    Repairing a clone nothing pulls is a different question again, and this
    cannot answer it -- precedent_refresh_sources.py does, per attached
    source, at every session start.

    The clone is made from the CLEAN url -- the credential travels as a git
    helper that reads the environment itself, so no token is ever written
    into .git/config, where it would outlive this process and be pushed by
    whoever committed next.

    The branch is PINNED, never asked for -- see SOURCE_BRANCH_DEFAULT above
    for the incident. Two halves, and the second is the one that made the
    first incident persist: a fresh clone takes --branch, and an existing
    clone is put back on that branch BEFORE pulling, because `git pull
    --ff-only` pulls whatever branch the checkout is already sitting on. A
    clone that landed on the wrong branch once therefore stayed there and
    kept pulling it, session after session, with nothing saying so."""
