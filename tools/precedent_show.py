"""precedent_show.py — the one code path every loading channel calls
(PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md, "Loading a Practice Means Loading Its Rule, Not
Its File"). An agent never reads a practices/*.md file directly: it calls
this, and only this command's output enters context. That is what makes the
Rule/Detail/Why/Story/Install split actually save tokens — reading the file directly would
front-load the whole thing, Story included, defeating the split.

Multiple slugs concatenate, each under its own "### slug" heading, so a
caller loading several practices for one occasion gets one block back.

Exit 1, with a clear message naming the missing slug, on any slug that
doesn't resolve to a practices/*.md file -- this is a degrade-gracefully
tool (personal pack fail-gracefully, generalized): a bad slug in an occasion
index entry should be loud, not a silent empty read.

WHEN practices/ IS A tools/precedent_materialize.py-PRODUCED SNAPSHOT (a
consumer repo resolving universal/team/individual/repo-local together,
signalled by that directory's own MANIFEST.json -- never true for a source
repo's own hand-authored practices/): a slug whose declared source is not
reachable THIS session gets a trailing note naming that, on the READ side
of the gap practices/session-bootstrap.md's Story records on the write
side -- a materialized file is whatever was on disk at the last successful
materialize() run, and reading it proves nothing about whether that run's
source is still there today. See _source_unreachable_note's own docstring
for what this checks (a cheap directory probe) and deliberately does not
(a full precedent_resolve.py re-resolve, or a content-drift check against
the live source -- precedent_sync_views.py --check already owns that, at
the whole-tree granularity where it belongs).
