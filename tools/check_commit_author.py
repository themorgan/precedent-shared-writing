"""Each commit is authored as the declared person (practice commit-author)

The engine's one copy of this check, for every kind of repository.

Its rule, commit-author, lives in a person's own practice set, not in the
universal catalogue, so it is named here without a citation: engine code
cites only the catalogue it ships with (code-cites-practice).
precedent_push_check.IDENTITY_SLUGS and the practice's checked_by tie the
two together.

ONE COPY, SHIPPED BY THE ENGINE (Morgan, 2026-10-10: "yes ... build the
shared check"). This file and its twin, check_commit_dates.py, live in tools/ as engine
files, so every repository runs the same copy: BestPractice, every practice
set and every consumer. Until that day the practice's own set (the person's
individual set) shipped a copy in tools/checks/, which every consumer
materialized, while BestPractice kept a port of its own. The two drifted:
the set's copies lacked the bot-author warning, PRECEDENT_CHECK_RANGE and
the skip of commits GitHub makes, and a consumer's merge gate refused every
GitHub-button merge for it. Nothing personal is written here: the zone and
the author come from the declared identity, and a repository's own
exemptions from its identity.json or precedent.json.

Scope: tree. Every commit reachable from HEAD in this repo must be authored
as the person this repo's DECLARED IDENTITY names -- both the git-recorded
author name and email, which is what `git config user.name`/`user.email`
actually produces on every subsequent commit once set correctly.

THE NAME AND ADDRESS ARE NOT WRITTEN HERE, and since 2026-09-10 they are
not read from a root `identity.json` here either: they come from
`precedent_identity.declared_identity()`, which resolves them the way
commit-identity.sh does. See the long block above `_resolve()` for why that
matters -- in short, an `identity.json` at a repo's root means "this repo
is somebody's individual practice source", so requiring one made this check
permanently red in every SHARED consuming repo. This check is therefore
generic: the same file, materialized into anybody's repo, checks the
commits there against whichever person that repo can actually resolve, and
stands down where nobody is declared. It also verifies that everything else
which needs those values -- the `env` block in `.claude/settings.json` --
still agrees with that one declaration, which is the half that keeps "one
place" true rather than merely intended.

Exit 0 and print nothing when clean. Exit 1 and print the practice's own
Rule text (never a paraphrase) plus the specific finding(s) on a violation.
Exit 2, printing SKIPPED and a reason, when the check could not run at all
-- no identity is declared anywhere reachable (a shared repo, the expected
state there and not a defect), or the engine module is absent. That is
precedent_check.py's own convention for a source-supplied script, and its
runner turns exit 2 into SKIPPED rather than into a pass.

# THE DECLARED IDENTITY IS THE ENGINE'S ANSWER, NOT THIS SCRIPT'S (2026-09-10)
#
# This check used to read `identity.json` at ROOT itself and report a
# VIOLATION when it was absent. But an identity.json at a repo's root MEANS
# "this repository is somebody's individual practice source" -- it is step 2
# of commit-identity.sh's own resolution order -- so a SHARED consuming repo
# must not have one, which is exactly what the per-repo grandfathering
# comment in check_commit_author.py already said at length. The two
# statements together left this check permanently red in every shared
# consuming repo, with the fix forbidden by the same file that demanded it.
# Found 2026-09-10 installing precedent-beta-v01 into a real private project
# via INSTALL.md section 0: the install ended on exactly these two checks,
# and writing reasoned `not_binding` exemptions for them did not help either.
#
# precedent_identity.declared_identity() answers it now, looking where
# commit-identity.sh looks and in the same order -- a PRECEDENT_COMMIT_*
# override, this repo's own identity.json, the individual source named by the
# user-level config -- and raising NoDeclaredIdentity when none of the three
# does. That is this check's cue to STAND DOWN, never to report a violation:
# a violation here must mean "a commit has the wrong author", not "this
# repository is shared". It deliberately stops there rather than falling
# through to the session owner, the authenticated GitHub account or an
# existing git config, the way commit-identity.sh continues to for AUTHORING
# a commit: those are inferences about an environment, and a check that
# judged a commit against the ambient git config would pass whatever it found.
#
# WHICH MODULE, 2026-09-10 (same day, second revision): the resolution
# moved upstream out of precedent_resolve.py into precedent_identity.py,
# which is in ENGINE_FILES rather than CONSUMER_ENGINE_FILES, so a practice
# SET vendors it too -- see _identity_module() below for why that matters and
# why the resolver is still tried second. mirrored_prefixes() stayed in the
# resolver, so the other checks here that use it are unaffected.
#
# THIS BLOCK IS DUPLICATED, verbatim, in the other identity check
# (check_commit_dates.py), and that is forced rather than sloppy:
# precedent_materialize.py
# copies only the `check_*.py` scripts a practice's `checked_by:` claims, so
# a shared helper module beside them would never travel into a consuming
# repo. rule_text() is duplicated across all eight checks here for the same
# reason.

    out of it the same day (upstream 2026-09-10): the resolver is in
    precedent_vendor_engine.py's CONSUMER_ENGINE_FILES and deliberately NOT
    in its ENGINE_FILES, because a practice SET resolves no catalogue -- so a
    set does not vendor it, and these two checks went from enforcing to
    SKIPPED inside the very set they belong to, which is not a state anyone
    wanted. Identity is a question about a PERSON, and a practice set is the
    one repository that most certainly has one: an `identity.json` at a

# tools/precedent_check.py printed the traceback as a VIOLATION of the
# practice itself -- the check crashing, reported as the repository
# misbehaving. A FRESH INSTALL IS EXACTLY A REPOSITORY WITH NO COMMITS, so
# every INSTALL.md section 0 install hit this, and hit it in both identity
# checks at once. Reported 2026-09-14 from the first section 0 install into
# a real project with subject matter of its own; invisible from inside a
# practice set, which has years of history to log.
#
# No history is a COULD-NOT-RUN -- never a pass, never a violation. There is
# no commit here yet to have the wrong author or the wrong offset, and the
# first one made is checked the moment it exists. So this raises the file's
# own NotApplicable (SKIPPED, exit 2) and SAYS WHICH could-not-run it is: a
# repository that declares no identity already skips for a different reason,
# and the two are only tellable apart by their message -- which is why the
# test for this asserts the wording and not just the exit code.
#
# DUPLICATED, verbatim, in the other identity check, for the reason the
# block above gives: precedent_materialize.py copies only the `check_*.py`
# scripts a practice's `checked_by:` claims, so a shared helper module
# sitting beside them would never travel into a consuming repo.

    ADDED 2026-09-22 (Morgan, same day: "Whole history reviews are good for
    things like very deep check but not for daily practice" -- practice:
    upstream-fix, cite-the-incident). commit-identity-push-gate.sh calls this
    script directly on every `git push`, bypassing precedent_check.py's own
    rotation slice on purpose (see that hook's header) -- and until now that
    meant EVERY commit reachable from HEAD was re-read and re-judged on
    EVERY push, forever. A commit already grandfathered paid that cost
    forever too; one that was fixed forward without a formal grandfather
    entry looked, from the next push on, exactly like a fresh violation --
    "an ancient issue that keeps coming back" is what that looks like from
    the outside, whether or not an entry was ever missing.

    `HEAD --not --remotes` is the same scoping the platform's own stop hook
    (outside this repo, not ours to edit) already uses, for the identical
    reason its own comment gives: once a commit is on a remote, checking it
    again on the NEXT push audits nothing new. Every commit still gets
    checked exactly once, at the one moment that is actually useful -- right
    before it is first published -- and never again after that: a STRICTER
    guarantee of eventual coverage than the old unconditional scan gave in
    practice anywhere else in this engine, since precedent_check.py's own
    ordinary runs only ever sampled these tree-scope checks on a rotation.

    A repo with no remote at all has no "already published" to exclude, so
    `git remote` coming back empty means the same thing PRECEDENT_CHECK_FULL_
