"""check_commit_author.py -- the mechanical check for practices/commit-author.md.

# practice: commit-author

Scope: tree. Every commit reachable from HEAD in this repo must be authored
as the person this repo's DECLARED IDENTITY names -- both the git-recorded
author name and email, which is what `git config user.name`/`user.email`
actually produces on every subsequent commit once set correctly.

THE NAME AND ADDRESS ARE NOT WRITTEN HERE, and since 2026-09-10 they are
not read from a root `identity.json` here either: they come from
`precedent_identity.declared_identity()`, which resolves them the way
commit-identity.sh does. See the long block above `_resolve()` for why that
matters -- in short, an `identity.json` at a repo's root means "this repo
is somebody's individual practice source", so requiring one made this check
permanently red in every SHARED consuming repo. This check is therefore
generic: the same file, materialized into anybody's repo, checks the
commits there against whichever person that repo can actually resolve, and
stands down where nobody is declared. It also verifies that everything else
which needs those values -- the `env` block in `.claude/settings.json` --
still agrees with that one declaration, which is the half that keeps "one
place" true rather than merely intended.

Exit 0 and print nothing when clean. Exit 1 and print the practice's own
Rule text (never a paraphrase) plus the specific finding(s) on a violation.
Exit 2, printing SKIPPED and a reason, when the check could not run at all
-- no identity is declared anywhere reachable (a shared repo, the expected
state there and not a defect), or the engine module is absent. That is
precedent_check.py's own convention for a source-supplied script, and its
runner turns exit 2 into SKIPPED rather than into a pass.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE DECLARED IDENTITY IS THE ENGINE'S ANSWER, NOT THIS SCRIPT'S (2026-09-10)
#
# This check used to read `identity.json` at ROOT itself and report a
# VIOLATION when it was absent. But an identity.json at a repo's root MEANS
# "this repository is somebody's individual practice source" -- it is step 2
# of commit-identity.sh's own resolution order -- so a SHARED consuming repo
# must not have one, which is exactly what the per-repo grandfathering
# comment in check_commit_author.py already said at length. The two
# statements together left this check permanently red in every shared
# consuming repo, with the fix forbidden by the same file that demanded it.
# Found 2026-09-10 installing precedent-beta-v01 into a real private project
# via INSTALL.md section 0: the install ended on exactly these two checks,
# and writing reasoned `not_binding` exemptions for them did not help either.
#
# precedent_identity.declared_identity() answers it now, looking where
# commit-identity.sh looks and in the same order -- a PRECEDENT_COMMIT_*
# override, this repo's own identity.json, the individual source named by the
# user-level config -- and raising NoDeclaredIdentity when none of the three
# does. That is this check's cue to STAND DOWN, never to report a violation:
# a violation here must mean "a commit has the wrong author", not "this
# repository is shared". It deliberately stops there rather than falling
# through to the session owner, the authenticated GitHub account or an
# existing git config, the way commit-identity.sh continues to for AUTHORING
# a commit: those are inferences about an environment, and a check that
# judged a commit against the ambient git config would pass whatever it found.
#
# WHICH MODULE, 2026-09-10 (same day, second revision): the resolution
# moved upstream out of precedent_resolve.py into precedent_identity.py,
# which is in ENGINE_FILES rather than CONSUMER_ENGINE_FILES, so a practice
# SET vendors it too -- see _identity_module() below for why that matters and
# why the resolver is still tried second. mirrored_prefixes() stayed in the
# resolver, so the other checks here that use it are unaffected.
#
# THIS BLOCK IS DUPLICATED, verbatim, in the other identity check
# (check_buenos_aires_dates.py), and that is forced rather than sloppy:
# precedent_materialize.py
# copies only the `check_*.py` scripts a practice's `checked_by:` claims, so
# a shared helper module beside them would never travel into a consuming
# repo. rule_text() is duplicated across all eight checks here for the same
# reason.

    out of it the same day (upstream 2026-09-10): the resolver is in
    precedent_vendor_engine.py's CONSUMER_ENGINE_FILES and deliberately NOT
    in its ENGINE_FILES, because a practice SET resolves no catalogue -- so a
    set does not vendor it, and these two checks went from enforcing to
    SKIPPED inside the very set they belong to, which is not a state anyone
    wanted. Identity is a question about a PERSON, and a practice set is the
    one repository that most certainly has one: an `identity.json` at a
    repo's root is what declares "this repository is somebody's individual
    practice source". So the resolution now lives in `precedent_identity.py`,
    which IS in ENGINE_FILES and reaches every kind of repo the engine
    reaches.

    The resolver keeps re-exporting both names, so the fallback below is for
    a CONSUMING repo whose vendored engine predates the split -- a
    compatibility path, never a preference. Anything in these sets that needs
    an identity imports `precedent_identity`; the resolver answers questions
    about a catalogue.

# aa2155d (2026-09-04, "next-steps-after-commit: also close with

# committing -- a one-off session mistake, not a gap in this check or a
# case for rewriting: the commit was already published (merged into main)
# by the time it was noticed, and Morgan's explicit instruction on
# 2026-09-04 was to grandfather it rather than rewrite.
# practice: no-rewrite-for-warnings -- FIVE MORE, 2026-09-05/06. Every one
# of these landed with the container's own default git identity and UTC
# clock because the session never set either before committing -- the same
# one-off that produced aa2155d, five more times in two days, which is what
# finally made it clear this was never a discipline problem. All five were
# already published (merged into main) by the time the checks ran on them,
# and Morgan's explicit instruction on 2026-09-06 was to grandfather rather
# than rewrite: the oldest of them is 977e360, so a rewrite would have

# PER-REPO exemptions, 2026-09-07. The set above is this SOURCE's own

# the repo it ships in. Materialized into a CONSUMER (themorgan/HavrutaBrainstorm
# was the first), it audits `ROOT`'s history instead, and no consumer can
# add to a set that lives in a file precedent_materialize.py overwrites on
# every sync. identity.json is already the one per-ROOT declaration this
# check reads (see IDENTITY_FILE above) -- an optional
# "grandfathered_commit_shas" array there is the same mechanism, one level
# down: {"sha": <40-hex>, "note": <why>} entries, additive to the set above,
# never a replacement for it. A malformed entry (no "sha", or not 40 hex
# characters) is reported as a finding rather than silently ignored -- a
# grandfather list that silently drops an entry is indistinguishable from
# one that was never declared, which defeats the point of writing it down.
# WHERE A CONSUMER DECLARES ITS OWN EXEMPTIONS, 2026-09-07. identity.json
# was the only place this looked, and that is wrong for the repos this check
# actually materializes into. An identity.json at a repo's root MEANS "this
# repository is somebody's individual practice source" -- commit-identity.sh
# resolves it that way, second in its own order -- so putting one into a
# shared consuming repo to hold a grandfather list would pin one person's
# identity onto everyone committing there.
#
# themorgan/nomen-omen is exactly that case and is what surfaced it: a
# two-member repo whose own instructions warn, at length, that the identity
# rules are facts about one person and must not carry over to the other
# member. Declaring Morgan's identity.json at its root to exempt seven
# commits would have committed precisely the error that file spends a
# paragraph forbidding.
#
# precedent.json is the consumer-level declaration file -- it is where

    Deliberately runs against the REAL ambient environment (this session's

    the script apply a declaration correctly" independent of the network

# check=True: the CalledProcessError escaped find_violations(), and

# practice itself -- the check crashing, reported as the repository
# misbehaving. A FRESH INSTALL IS EXACTLY A REPOSITORY WITH NO COMMITS, so
# every INSTALL.md section 0 install hit this, and hit it in both identity
# checks at once. Reported 2026-09-14 from the first section 0 install into
# a real project with subject matter of its own; invisible from inside a
# practice set, which has years of history to log.
#
# No history is a COULD-NOT-RUN -- never a pass, never a violation. There is
# no commit here yet to have the wrong author or the wrong offset, and the
# first one made is checked the moment it exists. So this raises the file's
# own NotApplicable (SKIPPED, exit 2) and SAYS WHICH could-not-run it is: a
# repository that declares no identity already skips for a different reason,
# and the two are only tellable apart by their message -- which is why the
# test for this asserts the wording and not just the exit code.
#
# DUPLICATED, verbatim, in the other identity check, for the reason the
# block above gives: precedent_materialize.py copies only the `check_*.py`
# scripts a practice's `checked_by:` claims, so a shared helper module
# sitting beside them would never travel into a consuming repo.
