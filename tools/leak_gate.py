"""leak_gate.py — the hard-failing leak gate
(PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md, "The Verification Harness": "Leak gate — no
individual- or team-level term appears anywhere in Precedent.
RPP's private-repo-scrub machinery generalized from words to sources,
hard-failing rather than warning.")

WHY THIS RUNS AT PUSH TIME AND NOT AT MERGE TIME. The plan originally put
this at phase 3 because Precedent was to be a fork, "private initially" --
a leak could be caught and force-pushed away before anyone outside could
see it. Precedent is now a branch of BestPractice, which is public, so
**every push is publication, into a repo we do not own**. There is no
grace period and nothing to force-push away. The gate therefore has to run
before the bytes leave the machine, not before a merge.

TWO LAYERS, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM CAN LIVE HERE.

  STRUCTURAL (this file, always on, runs in CI). Precedent holds universal
  practices and nothing else. Anything shaped like private-source content
  fails: a practice file outside practices/, a path belonging to an
  individual or team set, a practice whose frontmatter claims a non-
  universal source, a personal email address, an absolute home directory.
  These patterns are safe to publish because they describe SHAPES, not
  anyone's actual vocabulary.

  VOCABULARY, in two halves. This layer catches WORDS rather than shapes.

    The DEFAULT half (tools/leak-blocklist.default.txt) is committed and
    always applied -- terms that are unsafe to publish and safe to name,
    profanity first among them, in a repo whose documents are read by
    people outside the project. Nothing there is a secret, so committing it
    costs nothing.

    Its second job is the important one: it makes this layer actually RUN.
    Until 2026-09-06 the whole layer was skipped whenever
    PRECEDENT_LEAK_BLOCKLIST was unset -- every CI run, every fresh clone --
    so the code that loads, compiles and scans with patterns was exercised
    only by the harness, and the gate reported PARTIAL forever. A mechanism
    that runs only in its own tests is one nobody finds out is broken.

    The PRIVATE half catches private words -- client names, code words,
    internal identifiers -- and **that list cannot live in the repo it
    protects.** A blocklist of secret terms, committed to a public repo,
    publishes the secrets it exists to guard, and load_blocklist() refuses
    one located inside this repository for exactly that reason. This is the
    same reason (practice: scrub-gate) keeps the blocklist in the private
    dependent repo and scans the public vendored tree from there.

    It is named by PRECEDENT_LEAK_BLOCKLIST (a path outside this repo, e.g.
    in the individual set), and is MERGED with the default, never a
    replacement for it. With the variable unset the gate looks for
    `leak-blocklist.txt` in the individual source your user-level config
    names -- the location INSTALL.md section 8 already puts it -- so the
    layer runs without anyone exporting anything. The variable is an
    override, not the only route; --structural-only is still how a caller
    asks for the structural half by name. When it is not set the gate still reports OK -- the
    layer did run -- but says plainly that only the publishable half was
    checked. That sentence is not decoration: a clean scan against
    publishable terms is not evidence that no private word is present, and
    dropping it would leave the old silence with better wording.

  Once you HAVE a list, an unrun vocabulary layer must not exit 0 like a
  pass. `git config precedent.requireVocabulary true` in your clone (or
  --require-vocabulary) makes a missing PRECEDENT_LEAK_BLOCKLIST fatal, so
  losing the variable in a new shell fails the push instead of quietly
  downgrading it to the structural half.

  WRITE THE STEM, NOT THE WHOLE NAME. The two halves recognise different
  spellings: the allowlist matches `owner/name`, the patterns match the bare
  name. So a private repo whose pattern is its FULL name is guarded when
  written with a slash and naked when written short -- which is how a name
  leaked on 2026-09-07, as `<repo>-local`. Truncate each pattern to a
  distinctive head, and MEASURE the hit count against the tree before
  committing to the cut: a stem short enough to be an ordinary English word
  fires on innocent text, and a gate that cries wolf is a gate people
  switch off.

  To make the missing ones visible, a run with an owner declared also
  surveys the git clones on this disk and NOTES any repository under that
  owner whose bare name no pattern matches. It notes rather than refuses --
  a missing stem is latent risk, not a hit, and the content scan already
  covers what this tree says today. It is silent with no owner declared,
  which is also what keeps a private name out of a public CI log.
  `# visibility-audit: stem-notes off -- why` in the blocklist silences it
  on ordinary runs for the person whose file that is; --survey prints it
  regardless, and very_deep_check.py's visibility pass asks for it there, so
  the recommendation arrives inside a review somebody asked for rather than
  beside every push. A HIT is never silenceable by any of this.

  AND THE OTHER ANSWER TO THE SAME GAP, which refuses instead of reporting:
  `# visibility-audit: auto-cover-bare-names on -- why` makes every clone on
  this disk under a private-by-default owner, with no `allow` line, a
  whole-word pattern of its own. The bare name is then a hit, nobody has to
  write a stem, and nobody has to be asked to. Whole name only -- truncating
  to a stem is a judgment call that has to be measured against the tree, and
  no mechanism can make it. OFF by default, because unlike the note it can
  fail a push that passed yesterday.
  very_deep_check.py answers the same question from the other side, for the
  repositories this tree already NAMES, by asking GitHub which are private.

  WHEN IT FAILS, it also names the clone the private blocklist came from and
  how far behind its upstream that checkout is. A stale blocklist produces
  real-looking hits from a correct gate -- 2026-09-11, 30 of them, read as a
  defect in the tree and written into a pull request before anyone checked
  the clone's date. It never claims a clone is CURRENT, because an unfetched
  remote-tracking ref cannot show that, and it never fetches: a gate that
  reaches the network to grade itself can hang on a push.

CI runs the structural layer and the DEFAULT vocabulary half; it cannot run
the private half, having no access to a private list. That is a real limit, stated rather than papered over: CI is
the backstop that cannot be bypassed, the local hook is the one that knows
the words. Neither alone is the whole gate.

WHAT "WHAT A PUSH WOULD SEND" MEANS, since getting this wrong is how a
push-time gate passes on a publication. A push sends every COMMIT in the
range, not the tree they end at, so --range walks the range commit by
commit, reads each blob out of git rather than off disk, and scans every
commit MESSAGE too. --staged likewise reads the staged blob, not the
working-tree file. Three separate misses were found by testing this rather
than reading it -- see the comment above units_to_scan.

Run:
  python3 tools/leak_gate.py                  # whole tracked tree
  python3 tools/leak_gate.py --staged         # what is staged for commit
  python3 tools/leak_gate.py --range A..B     # what a push would send
  python3 tools/leak_gate.py --range "SHA --not --remotes"   # a new branch
  python3 tools/leak_gate.py --require-vocabulary            # fail if unrun
  python3 tools/leak_gate.py --explain        # what is checked, and what is not
Exit: 0 clean, 1 on any hit, on a misconfigured blocklist, or on an unrun
vocabulary layer this clone declared it needs.

#
#   1. `--range` used `git diff A..B`, the NET diff. A file added in one
#      commit and deleted in a later one in the same push does not appear in
#      it at all -- and its blob is published regardless, readable forever at
#      the commit that added it.
#   2. Both `--range` and `--staged` then read the WORKING TREE copy of each
#      name. A file staged with a private term and cleaned up afterwards, or
#      committed and then reverted, scanned as clean.
#   3. Commit messages were never scanned. They are published verbatim, and
#      a message is exactly where a session narrates what it was working on.
#
# So range mode walks the range commit by commit and reads blobs out of git,
# and staged mode reads the staged blob (`:path`) rather than the file.

# `owner/name` mention is refused unless it carries a reason:
#
#     # visibility-audit: private-owner <account> -- repos private by default
#     # visibility-audit: allow <account>/<repo> -- why this one may be named
#
# The example uses placeholders on purpose: this file is public, and writing
# a real account into it would be the rule leaking through its own manual.
#
# The set of names you may mention is small, stable and known to you. The set
# of repositories you might create is unbounded and grows without anyone
# thinking about the blocklist. Inverting the default puts the work where the
# knowledge is: naming a new private repo in a public tree now requires one
# line saying why, instead of requiring that somebody once predicted it.
#
# Both declarations live as COMMENTS in the private blocklist file, which is
# already the per-person place where "which names matter" is decided, and are
# read by very_deep_check.py's audit from the same file -- one declaration,

# A line that ANNOUNCES itself as a directive and parses as neither is a hard
# failure, not a comment. Both patterns above are single-line `re.match`
# against a stripped line -- there is no continuation syntax and never was --
# so a reason pushed onto the next comment line silently drops the whole
# directive. On an `allow` line that fails safe (the repository becomes
# refused). On the `private-owner` line it voids the ENTIRE repo-reference
# allowlist while the gate still prints OK, which is the fail-open shape this
# file exists to refuse.
#
# Characterized 2026-09-11 (Buenos Aires) by direct test, not by reading:
# `allow a/b -- reason` parses; `allow a/b -- reason that` followed by a
# continuation comment line parses with the reason TRUNCATED at the line end;
# `allow a/b --` with the reason on the next line parses as NOTHING AT ALL.
# The truncation case is deliberately left alone: it is lossy, not unsafe, and
# nothing can tell a deliberately terse reason from a wrapped one.
#
# The announce pattern is what makes a typo detectable at all. Before it, a
# misspelled directive was indistinguishable from an ordinary comment -- the
# file said a rule was configured and the parser saw prose.
# A third directive, and the only one that turns something OFF. The stem
# survey below NOTES every private-by-default clone on this disk whose bare
# name no pattern matches -- latent risk, reported on every run, because the
# moment to add a stem is while the repository is in front of you. That is
# right for a person who maintains their own blocklist and wrong for one who
# does not: Morgan, 2026-09-12, on being offered a stem for the third time --
# "I feel like I keep on getting errors and warnings and questions about it
# ... I just want to ignore it, UNTIL I tell you explicitly to add something
# to a blocklist." The notes do not go away, they MOVE: `--survey` prints
# them regardless, and very_deep_check.py's visibility pass calls it, so the
# recommendation arrives during a review somebody asked for instead of
# beside every push.
#
# It lives in the private blocklist because that file is already the
# per-person place where "which names matter" is decided. One person
# switching their notes off leaves everybody else's exactly as they were --
# which a git config could not promise, since a config is per container and
# dies with it.

# nothing covering it until somebody wrote a stem by hand -- which is the
# request the notes existed to make, and the request Morgan does not want to
# receive. Turning this on covers those names automatically: every clone on
# this disk under a private-by-default owner, with no `allow` line, becomes a
# whole-word pattern of its own, and naming one in the tree is a HIT.
#
# Morgan, 2026-09-12, after asking for the notes to stop: "there is ONE THING

#
# WHOLE NAME, NEVER A TRUNCATION. A hand-written stem is truncated to a

# to cut is a judgment call that has to be measured against the tree -- an
# over-short stem fires on ordinary English and a gate that cries wolf gets
# switched off. Nothing automatic can make that call, so it does not try: the
# exact repository name, on word boundaries. That covers the form somebody
# actually types and leaves the truncation to a person who wants one.

# --- Stem coverage: which private repos have no pattern at all ----------

# THE GAP THIS CLOSES. The allowlist above catches `owner/name`; the
# vocabulary patterns catch the BARE name. Only the first works for a
# repository nobody has written a pattern for -- so a private repo with no
# stem is guarded in its qualified form and naked in its short one, which is
# exactly how the 2026-09-07 leak got out: `<repo>-local`, no slash anywhere.
#
# WHY THE SCOPE IS "CLONES ON THIS DISK". Enumerating an account's
# repositories is not available -- `/user/repos` answers "sessions are bound
# to their configured repositories" -- and very_deep_check.py deliberately
# scopes its own audit to what the TREE names, on the ground that an unnamed
# repository is not a leak. Both are right and both miss the same case: a
# private repo you are working in right now, whose name has not reached this
# tree YET. A session working in one has it attached, and that is the moment
# its name is most likely to be typed into a document. So this takes the
# third scope, the only one that needs no network: the sibling checkouts.
#
# IT NOTES, IT DOES NOT REFUSE. A missing stem is latent risk, not a hit --
# the content scan already covers what this tree actually says, and failing
# a push over a directory sitting next to it would block work that leaks
# nothing. practice: fail-gracefully -- report what could not be guaranteed
# rather than either crying wolf or going quiet.
#
# IT CANNOT RUN IN CI, BY CONSTRUCTION, and that is deliberate: it needs the
# private blocklist's owner declaration, which CI never has. Printing a
# private repository's name into a public build log would be this rule
# leaking through its own mechanism.

    refused (dirty tree, diverged, no upstream, network failure, timeout).

    practice: durable-fix, cite-the-incident. 2026-09-20: the gate reported
    110 undeclared-repo hits, all false, all in a file the session had not
    touched -- the private clone was behind an upstream rename, the exact
    shape _stale_blocklist_clone_note() above already names. The note
    correctly pointed at `git -C <root> pull --ff-only`; the common case is
    that command succeeding, which nothing until now did automatically.

    Called ONLY once real hits exist, from main() below -- never at the top
    of an ordinary run. That is deliberate: _stale_blocklist_clone_note()'s
    own docstring declines to fetch because this gate "runs on every push"
    and a network call there would cost every clean push a round-trip. A

    touches the network; only a run that was already about to fail pays for
    one bounded attempt, on the chance the failure is stale input rather

    Never forces anything a person has to decide: a dirty tree, or a real
    divergence (local commits ahead as well as behind, exactly 2026-09-20's
    case), is left untouched, and this function simply declines rather than
    guessing which side to keep -- the same refusal

    fact about the repository, it is declared in a tracked file, and it

    2026-09-08, the incident: a session in a fresh container could not attach
    either private source, so the vocabulary layer had no blocklist to load.
    No git config existed to make that fatal, so the gate printed PARTIAL,

    applied -- into a public repository. The session reported it afterwards,
    accurately and too late. **"The check silently did not run" and "the

    whenever precedent.json DECLARES a private source refuses every session
    that could not attach one -- and in this repository that is a live,
    unexplained, intermittent condition (see AGENTS.md on cross-owner adds).

    **The first version had the threat model backwards.** Private vocabulary
    reaches a session by the session READING the private sources' text. A
    session that could not attach them never read a word of it and has
    nothing from them to leak; the dangerous session is the one that DID
    attach them and is now writing to a public tree. So resolution, not
    declaration, is what should require the list.

    What the blanket refusal actually bought was not safety. It relocated the
    work: the blocked session's remedy was to hand a patch to another session,
    which is more error-prone than the push it replaced -- and its commit
    "dies with the container", which is repo-is-memory losing outright.

    The residual risk when the sources did not resolve is a private term that
