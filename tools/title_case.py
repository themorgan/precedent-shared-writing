"""title_case.py — headline capitalization for markdown headings.

Checks (bare, the default) or applies (--write) New York Times headline
capitalization on every ATX heading in the files given, or, when none are
named, in every outward-facing document in the repo — everything except the
internal working files listed in INTERNAL_DIRS / INTERNAL_FILES below.

The rule, stated once so the output is arguable rather than magic:

  * The first and last word of a heading are always capitalized.
  * A word immediately after a colon or a dash is capitalized — it opens a
    new phrase.
  * Articles, coordinating conjunctions and short prepositions (SMALL below,
    the standard NYT list) are lowercased anywhere else.
  * Every other word gets its first letter capitalized and the REST OF THE
    WORD UNTOUCHED. That is what keeps AI, GitHub, PR and TODO intact
    without needing a dictionary of proper nouns.
  * Both halves of a hyphenated compound are capitalized (Multi-Person).

Fenced code blocks are skipped, so a ``` block containing a `# comment` is
never rewritten.

practice: headline-capitalization — this file IS that practice's definition,
not merely its enforcement: the rules above are stated here once so no
adopting repository restates them. Change them here and everywhere follows.

# EVERY document is outward-facing unless it is named here. Stated as an

# directories silently misses each new one somebody adds, which is exactly
# what happened here — the practice shipped covering `documentation/` alone,
# and `content/` and `book*/` had to be added the same day. An exclusion
# fails the safe way round: a directory nobody has classified is treated as
# published, and the worst case is a heading capitalized that did not need to
# be.
#
# WHAT COUNTS AS INTERNAL: the project managing itself. Practice files, the
# engine, specs, briefs, decision records, evaluation fixtures, templates
# awaiting instantiation, and the instructions/index/catalogue documents a
# session reads to work here. None of it is published to anyone, and heading
# style in it is never to be "fixed".

# `todo` and `gotchas` joined 2026-09-21, and it is the THIRD instance of the
# cause the note below already names. Both directories were created by the
# 2026-09-16 open-item migration, after this list was written, and both hold
# exactly the content this rule's own text calls out of scope: TODO.md is in
# INTERNAL_FILES below, and the migration is what split its items into
# todo/. Excluding the file and scanning the directory it became was never a
# decision anybody made. Caught when an ordinary todo item was refused for
# writing "## Why nothing caught it" instead of "## Why Nothing Caught It" --
# headline case, demanded of a working note nobody outside this project will
# ever read. Existing items passed only because a todo heading is
# conventionally one word ("## What", "## Why"), which is what kept it hidden.
# `record` joined `spec` on 2026-09-08, and it was missing for the same reason
# VOICE.md (see below) was once missing from INTERNAL_FILES: this list was
# written from the directories the repository HAPPENED TO HAVE at the time,
# and record/ did not exist yet -- spec/DOCUMENT_LIFECYCLE.md had planned it
# but nothing had created it. The two are twins by design (spec/ holds current
# normative reference, record/ holds the working record), so one being
# internal and the other outward was never a decision anybody made.

# A repository's root holds BOTH kinds, which is why directories alone cannot
# settle this: README.md and SETUP.md are the first things an outsider reads,
# while PRACTICES.md sits beside them and is pure
# internal machinery. Named individually, therefore. Three of these are also
# GENERATED (AGENTS.md, MAP.md, GLOSSARY.md) — rewriting a heading in one
# would be undone by the next tools/build_views.py run and fail its
# byte-identical check in between, so they could not be in scope even if they
# were outward-facing.
#
# STYLEGUIDE.md is here for a different reason, and the reason is the bug
# that put it here (2026-09-08, found by a consumer repo taking the beta
# update). THIS LIST WAS BUILT FROM UPSTREAM'S OWN ROOT NAMES, and upstream
# never instantiates it -- it ships as templates/STYLEGUIDE.md.template and
# only an ADOPTER ever has it at a root. So the check was blind to precisely
# the file this project hands out, and every adopter got the same false
# positive on a file whose own header says it is LOCAL ONLY. An adopter could
# clear it in precedent.json's `internal_paths`, but making each of them
# discover and fix the same upstream oversight is not a mechanism, it is a
# toll.
#
# VOICE.md used to be here for the identical reason, until 2026-09-17: it
# stopped being a root document at all (INSTALL.md's project-voice step) and
# became a repo-local PRACTICE at local/practices/project-voice.md instead --
# already internal because "local" is in INTERNAL_DIRS above, with nothing to
# add here. Kept as a footnote rather than deleted outright, because the next
# root file this bug repeats on will look exactly like this one did.
#
# The general lesson, which is why this comment is longer than the fix: a
# default derived from THIS repository's contents is wrong wherever the file
# is vendored, and it fails in the direction nobody checks -- upstream's own
# gate stays green, because upstream does not have the file.

# The two lists above are THIS repository's names, and this file is VENDORED
# into every consumer (precedent_vendor_engine.py's CONSUMER_ENGINE_FILES),
# where a refresh overwrites whatever an adopter edited into them. So a
# consumer had no way at all to say "this directory of mine is internal
# too" -- the exclusion default that fails safe here fails the other way
# there: every working directory nobody happened to name above reads as
# published. 2026-09-07, a real private consumer repo came back from
# an engine update with 69 outward-facing headings across 10 files, none of
# them outward-facing; the repo queued them in its TODO rather than sweep
# headings it did not want swept, which is the honest response and also a
# permanently noisy check.
#
# `internal_paths` in a repo's own precedent.json is how it says so, without
# touching this file. Each entry is a repo-relative path prefix -- a
# directory name (`notes`), a nested directory (`docs/drafts`), or a single
# file (`ROADMAP.md`) -- and matches that path and everything under it.
# Deliberately additive only: a consumer can EXCLUDE more, never re-include
# what the lists above exclude, so no consumer config can talk this module
# into rewriting headings in a vendored practices/ tree.
# `output_paths` INVERTS the question, and is the better answer wherever a
# repo will give one. Raised 2026-09-07 by Morgan, from a consuming repo that
# ran the rule against real output: the exclusion default reasons from THIS
# repo's directory names, so in any other tree it names almost nothing and
# classifies the entire working tree as published. `internal_paths` lets a
# consumer subtract, but subtracting everything-but-three-directories is a
# list that must be kept current forever, and the repo already knows the
# short answer -- "these three directories are what we publish".
#
# The exclusion default was chosen deliberately, to fail safe: an allowlist
# "silently misses each new one somebody adds", worst case "a heading
# capitalized that did not need to be". That holds INSIDE this repo. Outside
# it the failure is not one stray heading, it is every document in the repo,
# arriving as a check the repo cannot satisfy -- and a rule nobody can
# satisfy is a rule everybody learns to skip, which costs more than either
# failure. So the inversion is opt-in and the old default is untouched:
#
#   output_paths DECLARED -> those paths are output, everything else is
#     internal. The repo has answered the question.
#   output_paths ABSENT   -> exactly today's behaviour, so no existing
#     install moves under anyone's feet.
#
# `internal_paths` still subtracts, from whichever way the default fell.
# That is what expresses a vendored subtree sitting INSIDE an output
# directory -- a mirror maintained by a sync tool, whose headings would be
# "fixed" here and silently reverted on its next sync.
