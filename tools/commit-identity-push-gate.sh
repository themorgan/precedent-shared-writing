# Claude Code adapter: PreToolUse hook that REFUSES a `git push` whose
# history does not pass tools/checks/check_commit_author.py and
# tools/checks/check_buenos_aires_dates.py.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-09-21, practice: cite-the-incident). These two
# checks had just lost their last enforced home, and it took two moves to
# happen rather than one, which is why neither move looked like a mistake
# on the day it was made:
#
#   1. commit-identity.yml ran them on every non-draft pull request. On
#      2026-09-19 they were folded into precedent-check.yml as named steps
#      and that workflow was PAUSED -- the pause was safe precisely because
#      the fold had a destination.
#   2. On 2026-09-21 source-sets-run-no-ci deleted precedent-check.yml.
#      The destination went with it, and nothing re-read the paused
#      workflow's header to notice that its reason for being paused had
#      just stopped being true.
#
# So both checks ran nowhere after a push. Morgan, on being shown it:
# rehome them "onto that repo's own push gate rather than any workflow: a
# local gate costs no Actions minutes, so it survives the no-CI rule
# unchanged, which the CI fold did not."
#
# WHY A CLAUDE CODE HOOK AND NOT .git/hooks/pre-push. This machine sets
# `core.hooksPath` GLOBALLY to /root/.config/precedent/git-hooks, so a
# repo-local .git/hooks/pre-push is never executed -- checked, 2026-09-21,
# and this repo's own .git/hooks/pre-commit is a dead copy for that exact
# reason. Writing into the global directory instead would put this repo's
# checks on every push from every repository on the container, and would
# live outside the tree where nothing tracks it. This file is tracked,
# wired by tracked settings.json, and scoped to this repo alone.
#
# WHY PUSH AND NOT COMMIT, unlike doc-lint-gate.sh beside it. Both checks
# are scope `tree` -- they walk `git log` over every commit reachable from
# HEAD -- so a pre-commit gate cannot see the commit it is gating; that is
# the "a commit cannot be audited before it exists" blind spot
# commit-identity.yml was written to close. Push is the first moment the
# commit exists and the last one before it is published.
#
# WHY NOT LEAVE IT TO precedent_check.py. That runs both, but tree-scope
# checks there run on a ROTATION SLICE -- "covered within 10 commits", in
# its own output -- so a given push is not necessarily audited. These run
# every time.
#
# FAIL-CLOSED ON A FINDING, FAIL-OPEN ON THE PLUMBING, exactly as
# doc-lint-gate.sh does and for the same reason (practice: fail-gracefully):
# no jq, no python3, no git, no check script, an unparseable payload, or a
# check that CRASHES rather than reporting -- all exit 0, loudly on stderr
# where there is something to say. A gate that breaks a session over its
# own missing dependency is a gate somebody disables.
