"""precedent_branches.py -- the three branch tiers, and what a push to each
one is checked with. spec/BRANCH_TIERS_PLAN.md is the plan this implements.

THE RULE (Morgan, 2026-09-25, strength: decided): "to prestaging only the
most minimal test; to staging/precedent-beta-v01 all local tests; and then
to main, you get all those local tests AND the most important GitHub test",
and "the default for everyone should be all branches other than the above
never get tested beyond the basic markdown test when pushed to".

  pre-staging, and any other branch   basic  (markdown lint, leak gate,
                                               the commit-author checks)
  staging                             full   (everything
                                               precedent_push_check.py runs)
  main                                full, plus one GitHub test on the
                                               pull request into it

WHY ONE MODULE. The literal `precedent-beta-v01` sat in 249 files of this
repository when the plan was written, 37 of them under tools/. The same
three names are meant to hold in every repository, and the staging branch
is being renamed; every tool that needs a tier name asks here, so the
rename is a change in one place (practice: registry-source-of-truth).

STAGING BEFORE THE RENAME. Until a repository has a branch called
`staging`, its staging tier is whatever it declares as `base_branch` in
precedent.json -- `precedent-beta-v01` in the Precedent repositories. A
repository whose base_branch is `main` -- most repositories that install
Precedent -- has no separate staging branch yet, so its staging tier IS
main: pre-staging is created from main and promoted into main, and `Go
update` for a person who has not chosen pre-staging lands on main, as it
always did. (Until 2026-09-25 this answered `staging` there, a branch those
repositories do not have -- found before any of them had taken the engine.)

A PUSH NOBODY CAN READ IS CHECKED FULLY. push_targets() returns None for a
push whose destination it cannot establish (--all, --mirror, --tags, a tag
refspec, a detached HEAD), and tier_for_push() answers `full` for None.
Getting it wrong in that direction costs minutes; the other direction
lands unchecked work.

The person's setting, `branch_push_checks`, is read the way
spec/CI_CADENCE_PLAN.md reads its own: a repository's precedent.json wins,
then the person's identity.json (this repository's own when it is an
individual source, else the one ~/.config/precedent/config.json names),
then the default, `basic`. Nothing it says can lower staging or main.

WHERE `Go update` LANDS is the person's `landing_branch` setting, read
the same way: `pre-staging` (the default, for everyone, since 2026-09-25),
`staging`, or `main`. An unreadable value lands on staging, where work landed
before the tiers existed, never somewhere new.

PROMOTE moves pre-staging into staging (plan step 6; Morgan named the
command, strength: assented). It merges staging into pre-staging first when
staging has moved on its own, then makes a merge commit of pre-staging onto
staging -- always a merge commit, never a fast-forward, so a `[skip ci]`
line on a pre-staging commit can never become staging's head and silence
the GitHub test on the pull request into main (plan, hole 3) -- runs the
FULL push check on exactly that commit in a throwaway worktree, and pushes
it to staging only if it passes. It pushes by itself, so it runs the check
by itself: no push gate sees a push made from inside a script.

CLI:
  precedent_branches.py                     the tiers, as this repo resolves them
  precedent_branches.py --tier BRANCH       prints `basic` or `full`
  precedent_branches.py --push ARGS...      the tier a `git push ARGS...` gets
  precedent_branches.py --landing           where `Go update` lands for this person
  precedent_branches.py --sync-pre-staging  create pre-staging, or merge staging into it
  precedent_branches.py --promote           pre-staging into staging, fully checked
  precedent_branches.py --ensure-tiers [--apply]

# THE PROMOTE LOCK. Two windows promoting at once race: both run the full
# check, one push wins, and the other run was minutes thrown away (seen twice
# in a row on 2026-09-25). So a Promote first claims a lock on origin, and a
# second one that finds it held stops before doing anything.
#
# The lock is a BRANCH, because a web session's git proxy refuses a push to
# any ref outside refs/heads/ (gotchas/gotcha-2026-09-25-a-session-cannot-
# push-a-ref-outside-refs-heads.md), and it can never be deleted, for the
# same reason (practice: never-delete-a-remote-branch). So it is never
# created and removed: it only ever moves FORWARD, one empty commit per
# claim or release, and its newest commit's subject says its state --
# "held by ..." or "free". A plain (never forced) push is the compare-and-
# swap: if another window moved it first, the push is not a fast-forward
# and is refused, so two windows cannot both hold it. Each commit carries
# [skip ci], so a workflow that runs on every branch push spends nothing.
#
# A holder that dies leaves it held; after LOCK_STALE_SECONDS anyone may
# claim it on top. Morgan, 2026-09-25: "yes to the lock branch, very much
# approved and supported" (strength: decided).
