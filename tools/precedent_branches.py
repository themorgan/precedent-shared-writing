"""Where a person's work lands here (spec/LADDER_OPT_IN_PLAN.md D3) and whether a push to a branch gets the basic or the full push check; the branch tiers and their moves for a person whose set provides them (spec/BRANCH_TIERS_PLAN.md)

precedent_branches.py -- the three branch tiers, and what a push to each
one is checked with. spec/BRANCH_TIERS_PLAN.md is the plan this implements.

THE RULE (Morgan, 2026-09-25, strength: decided): "to prestaging only the
most minimal test; to staging/precedent-beta-v01 all local tests; and then
to main, you get all those local tests AND the most important GitHub test",
and "the default for everyone should be all branches other than the above
never get tested beyond the basic markdown test when pushed to".

  pre-staging, and any other branch   basic  (markdown lint, leak gate,
                                               the commit-author checks)
  staging                             full   (everything
                                               precedent_push_check.py runs)
  main                                full, plus one GitHub test on the
                                               pull request into it

WHY ONE MODULE. The literal `precedent-beta-v01` sat in 249 files of this
repository when the plan was written, 37 of them under tools/. The same
three names are meant to hold in every repository, and the staging branch
is being renamed; every tool that needs a tier name asks here, so the
rename is a change in one place (practice: registry-source-of-truth).

STAGING BEFORE THE RENAME. Until a repository has a branch called
`staging`, its staging tier is whatever it declares as `base_branch` in
precedent.json -- `precedent-beta-v01` in the Precedent repositories. A
repository whose base_branch is `main` -- most repositories that install
Precedent -- has no separate staging branch yet, so its staging tier IS
main: pre-staging is created from main and promoted into main, and `Go
update` for a person who has not chosen pre-staging lands on main, as it
always did. (Until 2026-09-25 this answered `staging` there, a branch those
repositories do not have -- found before any of them had taken the engine.)

A PUSH NOBODY CAN READ IS CHECKED FULLY. push_targets() returns None for a
push whose destination it cannot establish (--all, --mirror, --tags, a tag
refspec, a detached HEAD), and tier_for_push() answers `full` for None.
Getting it wrong in that direction costs minutes; the other direction
lands unchecked work.

The person's setting, `branch_push_checks`, is read the way
spec/CI_CADENCE_PLAN.md reads its own: a repository's precedent.json wins,
then the person's identity.json (this repository's own when it is an
individual source, else the one ~/.config/precedent/config.json names),
then the default, `basic`. Nothing it says can lower staging or main.

WHERE `Go update` LANDS is `landing_branch`: `pre-staging`, `staging` or
`main`. Read in the OTHER order from `branch_push_checks`: the person's own
identity.json first, then the repository's precedent.json, then the built-in
default, `staging` (Morgan, 2026-09-27, strength: decided: "have the
individual repo take precedence over the others (if it set, use that)").
Where a person works is theirs to choose; a repository's value is its
default for everyone who has not. New repositories are written with
`pre-staging` (precedent_install.py, the document-project template, a new
practice set), and Update Vendors adds it to one that has none. An
unreadable value lands on staging, where work landed before the tiers
existed, never somewhere new.

PROMOTE moves pre-staging into staging (plan step 6; Morgan named the
command, strength: assented). Since 2026-10-03 it COMPOSES one tree in a
throwaway worktree -- staging, then any fix branch it is handed (--work
DATE-promote-fix-ID), then work made directly on main, then pre-staging -- each
by a merge commit, never a fast-forward, so a `[skip ci]` line on a
pre-staging commit can never become staging's head and silence the GitHub
test on the pull request into main (plan, hole 3). It rebuilds the
generated files main's work left stale, runs the FULL push check on that
tree once, and only if it passes moves staging AND pre-staging to that same
commit in one atomic push. A failure or a conflict in hand-written text
moves neither: the tree goes to a local DATE-promote-fix-ID branch
(named like every temporary branch since 2026-10-06; promote-fix-DATE
before, still recognized), to be fixed
there and promoted with --work (spec/LADDER_OPT_IN_PLAN.md D10; see the
comment above _promote_unlocked). It pushes by itself, so it runs the check
by itself: no push gate sees a push made from inside a script.

PROMOTE ALSO MOVES STAGING INTO MAIN, since 2026-09-26, and picks which of
the two steps to run (promotion_step): the one the session names with --to,
else pre-staging first whenever it has work waiting -- including when the
work the session was just on (--work) waits on staging for main, since both
steps waiting makes the Promote ambiguous -- else the one --work needs. It prints "Now promoting from X to Y" before
anything else. Into main it runs the same full check on staging merged into
main, then pushes a throwaway copy of staging for the pull request into
main; that pull request's GitHub test is main's last gate, so main itself
is never pushed from here. That state exits 3 (PROMOTE_MAIN_NOT_MOVED), not
0, and says first that main has not moved: exit 0 means the branch moved.

EVERY PROMOTE ENDS WITH ONE RESULT LINE (2026-10-08). Whatever path a run
takes -- moved, nothing to move, refused, not finished, ready for main's
pull request, or stopped by an error -- the last line it prints is

  PROMOTE RESULT: <to> <- <from>: <verdict>

with any commit in it written in full. A session reads that one line from
the command's own output: a consuming repository's session that wrote a
Debut's log to a file was refused the `tail` that would have read it back,
and could not say whether the Debut had worked.

IN A PRIVATE REPOSITORY THAT GITHUB TEST RUNS AT MOST ONCE EVERY
github_ci_every_hours (2026-10-01, spec/CI_CADENCE_PLAN.md, "Promote
decides"; see main_test_due). When it is not due, the copy is named
DATE-promote-to-main-not-due-ID (to-main-not-due-DATE before
2026-10-06, and still where a GitHub test knows only that), the light check's job skips that pull request before
a runner starts, and --wait-main-test says NOT DUE and exits 0.

# DRIFT FROM ABOVE (spec/BRANCH_TIERS_PLAN.md, holes 2, 4 and 5). Work is

# by the pull request from staging. Some of it arrives from above instead --
# a direct push to staging, a workflow's bot commit on main, an edit made
# on GitHub's website -- and none of that passed through pre-staging, so
# the windows syncing from there never see it, and the next pull request
# into main meets it as a conflict. The sync copies it DOWN into
# pre-staging, and only once the tier it sits on has had its own checks:
# staging's full local check, and on main that plus the GitHub test.

# checks and if not we should do it, including the GitHub CI/CD for main,
# and also for staging, if it got there through a different route, to make
# sure it has our staging ones". And on the copy itself, to "whenever the
# robot adds something to main, copy it back down to the lower branches":
# "I love it."
#
# ONLY A FILE CHANGE COUNTS. Right after an ordinary staging-to-main pull
# request, main is ahead of pre-staging by two merge commits -- the Promote
# merge and the pull request's -- whose files pre-staging already has
# (measured 2026-09-26 in two repositories). The test is whether merging the
# upper branch in would change a file, not whether the two trees are equal:
# a plain diff of the tips calls main "different" whenever staging has moved
# on past it, which on that day was true in this repository too. Morgan, on
# leaving those merges alone: "yes add that".

# BEFORE the github workflow yaml is triggered so that, if it's not being
# run, it doesn't even get to the github point", then "Act ... 168 hours"
# (strength: decided).
#
# THE DECISION IS MADE HERE, IN THE SESSION, WHERE IT COSTS NOTHING. The
# retired ci_debounce_minutes made it inside a GitHub job, which billed a
# minute to decide not to spend one (spec/BILLING_FLOOR.md). Promote names
# the pull request's branch NOT_DUE_PREFIX... when no test is due, and the
# light-check template's job `if:` skips on that name before a runner
# starts.
#
# THE PERSON'S VALUE WINS HERE, the reverse of the commit hook. Morgan: "if
# it conflicts, and I run promote, it still skips it but the repo owner's
# wins on the 2A method" -- the commit hook's [skip ci] (precedent-ci-cadence)
# keeps the repository's own value first.
#
# EVERY DOUBT RUNS THE TEST: a public or undeclared repository, a value of 0
# or one that is not a number, PRECEDENT_CI_NOW=1, no passing run found, a
# newest run that failed, or GitHub not answering. A batch that changes a
# workflow or the vendored engine is NOT forced: Morgan, 2026-10-01, "I'm
# hesitant about forcing that, because I might update the vendored engines a
# lot or I can quickly see this getting out of control" (strength: decided).
#
# ONLY A DUE PROMOTE COPY RUNS IN A PRIVATE REPOSITORY. The light check's
# job `if:` runs a private pull request into main only when its branch is
# a to-main- copy that is not NOT_DUE_PREFIX: GitHub cannot read anyone's
# settings, so a pull request nobody judged is never tested there. Morgan:
# "if and only if the setting is turned on ... AND the number of hours is
# more than the number defined since the last successful test".

# THE PROMOTE LOCK. Two windows promoting at once race: both run the full
# check, one push wins, and the other run was minutes thrown away (seen twice
# in a row on 2026-09-25). So a Promote first claims a lock on origin, and a
# second one that finds it held stops before doing anything.
#
# The lock is a BRANCH, because a web session's git proxy refuses a push to
# any ref outside refs/heads/ (gotchas/gotcha-2026-09-25-a-session-cannot-
# push-a-ref-outside-refs-heads.md), and it can never be deleted, for the
# same reason (practice: never-delete-a-remote-branch). So it is never
# created and removed: it only ever moves FORWARD, one empty commit per
# claim or release, and its newest commit's subject says its state --
# "held by ..." or "free". A plain (never forced) push is the compare-and-
# swap: if another window moved it first, the push is not a fast-forward
# and is refused, so two windows cannot both hold it. Each commit carries
# [skip ci], so a workflow that runs on every branch push spends nothing.
#
# A holder that dies leaves it held; after LOCK_STALE_SECONDS anyone may
# claim it on top. Morgan, 2026-09-25: "yes to the lock branch, very much
# approved and supported" (strength: decided).
#
# 20 minutes, down from 45, on 2026-09-26. That day a window died holding
# the lock and every Promote said in other windows did nothing for the full
# 45 minutes, while staging sat still. A live Promote holds it for its one
# full check plus a merge and a push: the slowest full check measured that
# day took 379 seconds, so 20 minutes is still about three times what a
# live holder needs. Morgan: "Please update the lock to be 20 minutes
# unless you disagree" (strength: decided).
#
# 15 minutes, down from 20, later on 2026-09-26. 900 seconds is still about
# two and a half times that slowest 379-second check. An overrun costs one
# wasted check run, never a commit: the later window's plain push to staging
# is refused. Morgan: "Let's update that again to 15 minutes ... this should
# be more than enough" (strength: decided).
