"""At a merge: when the vendored engine or catalogue is behind, runs Update Vendors from the BestPractice clone and commits the result on its own, or takes it all back and says why; never blocks the merge

precedent_merge_vendors.py -- a merge takes the vendor update with it.

Run from a consuming repository at a merge, after the base branch has been
merged in and committed and before the result is pushed:

    python3 tools/precedent_merge_vendors.py

It asks precedent_engine_freshness.py whether the vendored engine or a
vendored catalogue is behind its upstream. Nothing behind: it says so and
stops, in about the time a fetch takes, and the views check below adds
seconds. Something behind: it runs Update
Vendors (the source clone's tools/precedent_update.py, which carries its
own check) and then does one of two things, never a third:

  DONE      the update is committed as a commit of its own, so it can be
            read, reverted or cherry-picked apart from the work it rode in
            with, and the merge pushes it.
  NOT TAKEN the update left something for a person to decide, or its check
            is red, or it could not run. Everything it wrote is taken back
            -- only what it wrote; a run that would touch anything else is
            refused before it starts -- and the reason is printed. The
            merge goes ahead without it.

A change under .claude/ (hooks, settings) is committed only with the
person's words in PRECEDENT_HARNESS_GO_AHEAD, since Claude Code's auto mode
holds such a commit; without them the update is NOT TAKEN, and says why.

Then, whether or not anything was behind, it asks the repository's own
precedent_sync_views.py whether a moved practice source left the views
stale, and if so refreshes them as one more commit of their own (VIEWS:
refreshed), or takes the refresh back and says why (VIEWS: ... NOT
REFRESHED) -- refresh_views says when.

It never blocks a merge: the exit status is 0 in every one of those
outcomes, and 2 only for a call it could not make sense of. Whatever it
printed belongs in the reply, because "not taken" is a question waiting for
the person.

WHY (2026-10-02, Alex: "Can we set up a system so merge also does vendor
updates?"). The freshness notice already printed at every merge gate --
"ENGINE BEHIND UPSTREAM ... To take it: Update Vendors" -- and a notice is
what had already failed: on 2026-09-20 18 of 22 repositories had never taken
an update, and the ones that did took it in one painful batch. A merge is
the moment a branch is being checked and pushed anyway, so the update rides
there, small and often.

Preconditions, each refused with its reason rather than worked around:
no merge in progress (commit it first), and no tracked file changed but
uncommitted (the update's output must be the only thing in its commit, and
the only thing taken back). Untracked files are left alone, as Update
Vendors always leaves them.

Run:
  python3 tools/precedent_merge_vendors.py              # at a merge
  python3 tools/precedent_merge_vendors.py --check-only # only say whether it would
  python3 tools/precedent_merge_vendors.py --always     # update without asking freshness
  python3 tools/precedent_merge_vendors.py --source DIR # the BestPractice clone to run
