"""precedent_candidate.py — Stage 2 of PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md's creation
pipeline: raise, list, and expire candidates. See spec/CANDIDATE_FORMAT.md
for the file schema this reads and writes.

A candidate is NEVER a practice and is NEVER loaded into context by any
loader tool (build_views.py, precedent_paths.py, precedent_resolve.py all
ignore candidates/ entirely) — creating one costs nothing, ignoring one
costs nothing, per the plan's own text.

LEVEL DECIDES STORAGE, exactly like a practice's level decides which
repository it lives in (spec/SOURCES.md):

  individual         ->  always a dated file in <repo path>/candidates/*.md.
                          There is no one else whose approval could be
                          missing -- you own the set, so a candidate here is
                          for deferring a decision, never for asking someone
                          else's permission.
  team               ->  a dated file in <repo path>/candidates/*.md BY
                          DEFAULT, same as individual -- but pass --as-issue
                          to draft a GitHub Issue on that shared-set repo instead.
                          WHICH ONE TO USE IS ABOUT AUTHORITY, NOT ACCESS
                          (2026-09-02, added after a real dependent-repo
                          session worked through this): if whoever is
                          raising this is already a listed approver in the
                          shared-set repo's approvers.json, their own say-so is
                          the approval PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md already
                          describes ("for a small team ... the session
                          commits it directly") -- promote and land it now,
                          skip raising a candidate at all. Raise a candidate
                          only when you're deliberately deferring, or when
                          --as-issue's real case applies: the person raising
                          it is NOT a listed approver, so no amount of git
                          write access changes the fact that someone else's
                          yes is actually needed. A quiet candidates/ file
                          nobody is watching for doesn't accomplish that; an
                          Issue does. This tool nudges (does not require)
                          landing directly instead, when --raised-by is
                          already on the approvers list.
  universal          ->  a GitHub Issue, never a file -- tools/leak_gate.py's
                          FORBIDDEN_PATHS already bans any candidates/ or
                          outbox/ directory in Precedent, unconditionally, by
                          shape rather than content (spec/SOURCES.md,
                          "Universal candidates are GitHub Issues"). This
                          tool can only draft the Issue body -- opening it
                          needs a GitHub credential this tool does not carry,
                          which is the plan's own "Per-repo credentials...
                          not day one" deferral, not an oversight. The same
                          is true of a team --as-issue draft: this tool
                          drafts the body and, best-effort, the target URL --
                          it never calls the GitHub API itself.
