"""Did this session's SessionStart hooks actually run? -- and repair it.

practice: session-bootstrap, fail-gracefully

THE INCIDENT, 2026-09-08. A session opened with four Precedent repositories
side by side under a parent directory -- this project's own required layout,
since a team source resolves as a SIBLING CLONE -- and the harness rooted the
session at that PARENT. `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` was therefore `/home/user`,
which has no `.claude/` of its own, so every hook in every one of the four
repositories' `settings.json` pointed at a path that does not exist. None of
them ran. Silently: a hook that cannot be found is not an error anybody sees.

What was missing, all at once, for a session doing a full review before the
work was shown to its reviewer: the commit identity (so commits would have
been authored by the container's bot and refused by this repo's own check),
the global commit backstop, the freshness guard, the package installs, the
path-trigger channel, the Stop-time git check, and
`.precedent/SESSION_PRACTICES.md` -- which is the ONLY route by which the
team and individual practices in force reach a session at all. AGENTS.md's
Standing Instruction tells every session to read that file; there was no file.

WHY THE EXISTING GOTCHA DID NOT COVER IT. AGENTS.md already records that a
repo ATTACHED mid-session never runs its own SessionStart hook. This is the
sibling failure and reads as its opposite: the repository is the one the
session is working in, its hooks are correctly wired, committed and
executable, and they still never fire -- because the session's root is one
directory ABOVE the repository. The multi-repo layout that causes it is not
exotic, it is what Precedent's own source resolution requires.

WHY THIS IS A TOOL AND NOT A HOOK. It cannot be a hook. The failure IS that
hooks do not run, so anything that waits to be triggered is the one thing
guaranteed not to fire (the same shape AGENTS.md records for a freshness
guard shipped inside the checkout it guards). It is reachable three ways
instead: AGENTS.md names it in the first-tool-call banner a session reads
before anything else, `--apply` makes the repair one command rather than
three remembered ones, and `remind()` below is printed by every
tools/precedent_gate.py moment.

THE THIRD ROUTE EXISTS BECAUSE THE FIRST TWO ARE SKIPPABLE, 2026-09-14. A
session read that banner, did not run this tool, and worked for hours with
four guarantees down -- no session-practices file, no commit backstop, two
uninstalled packages -- noticing only when the packages surfaced as three
unrelated-looking verify_harness failures (record/GOTCHAS.md#g1). Guidance a
session can skip is not a mechanism; a gate it runs at a named moment is.

Exit 0 when every guarantee holds, 1 otherwise, so it can gate a run.
