"""precedent_detect.py — Stage 1 of PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md's creation
pipeline: the mechanical half of detection. Every subcommand REPORTS a
detection; none of them raises a candidate automatically — "detection
produces a candidate, never a practice" (Stage 2) means a human decides
whether to act on what this prints, the same way `precedent_check.py`
reports a violation without writing the fix itself.

What is and is not built here, stated plainly (this repo's own convention
for a check that resists full coverage — see spec/ATTENTION_CEILING.md's
enforcement section):

  explicit-instruction   BUILT. A phrase detector over supplied text (a
                          message, a commit body) — "from now on," "always,"
                          "never," "going forward." No script can read a
                          live conversation; a session pipes the relevant
                          text through this itself.
  reverted-or-corrected  BUILT. A git-log scan for revert-shaped commits.
  restated-in-second-scope  BUILT. Cross-source duplicate-Rule-text scan —
                          reuses precedent_promote.py's own word-overlap
                          logic, which is the actual promotion signal this
                          detects (Stage 1: "a practice has been restated in
                          a second scope, which is the promotion signal").
  repeated-instruction   NOT a separate detector. Raising a second candidate
                          file for the same slug already IS how this signal
                          is captured — precedent_promote.py's recurrence
                          criterion counts files, by design
                          (spec/CANDIDATE_FORMAT.md).
  repeated-check-failure NOT BUILT. Needs a persistent log of check runs
                          over time; none exists in this codebase (no tool
                          here records pass/fail history across runs, only
                          the current run's result). Left as a real gap
                          rather than faked with a single-run proxy.
  review-found-defect    NOT a separate detector. Already the
                          `mistakes-become-rules` practice's own trigger,
                          reached via the existing `review` gate
                          (precedent_gate.py review) — a review that finds a
                          defect raises a candidate via precedent_candidate.py
                          directly; there is no separate mechanical signature
                          to detect beyond what that gate already surfaces.
