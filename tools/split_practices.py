"""split_practices.py — convert PRACTICES.md into one file per practice
(practices/<slug>.md), and the reverse: rebuild a PRACTICES.md-equivalent
catalogue view from those files, for the harness's byte-identical-regeneration
check (see spec/PRACTICE_FORMAT.md).

MECHANICAL, NOT EDITORIAL. Per the practice-engine plan (PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md,
"The Converter"): "no sentence may appear in the output that does not appear in
the input. The converter may move and drop text, never invent it." This script
follows that to the letter — the only judgment it embeds is the fixed label ->
section mapping below, applied uniformly, never a per-practice content read.

BestPractice's PRACTICES.md is NOT uniformly structured (found while writing
this): practices 1-46ish open with explicit **Rule.**/**Why.**/**Install.**
bold labels; practices 40-43 use **The practice.** instead of **Rule.**;
practices 47-52 have no leading bold label at all — the body just starts as
plain prose. A purely regex-anchored "grab the **Why.** paragraph" extractor
breaks on the second group. So parsing is done as a general label/carry-forward
walk instead: read the body as a sequence of paragraphs; track a
"current section", which starts at 'rule' and only changes when a paragraph
OPENS with a recognized bold label (**Rule.**, **The practice.**, **Why...**,
**Install.**, **Related...**); every other paragraph — including one that opens
with an UNRECOGNIZED bold sub-heading, e.g. mistakes-become-rules's
"**Proportionality guard.**" — stays in whatever section is already open. This carries every
sentence into some section with zero content invented and zero content lost,
regardless of which of the two source formats a given practice used.

Two structural decisions this makes, stated so they can be revisited:

  - Story is not populated. The plan's Rule/Why/Story split additionally asks
    for the *incident* to be separated out from the *reasoning* within Why —
    that is real editorial judgment, described in the plan itself as
    "LLM-assisted and human-reviewed, once per practice" (Migration, "The
    Converter"). Doing that with real care for 52 practices in one pass,
    unreviewed, risked mischaracterizing exactly the content this plan is
    built to preserve faithfully. So for phase 1: `## Story` exists as a
    section header in every practice file, with no body — a deliberate,
    flagged gap, not a silent one. Splitting it is follow-on work.
  - `## Install` is a fourth section, alongside Rule/Why/Story, not present
    in the plan's own illustrative frontmatter example. BestPractice's
    "Install." text (how a dependent repo actually installs the practice —
    template paths, tool names, wiring) has no other home in the plan's
    three-section spec, and dropping it would both violate the no-invented-
    /no-lost-content rule and break "byte-identical regeneration", since the
    original PRACTICES.md is Rule+Why+Install and nothing else per practice.
    See spec/PRACTICE_FORMAT.md for the full note on this.

One documented exception to the "move and drop only" rule: pr-template-honest-gates's
raw body in the source file is followed, in the source, by a stray duplicate
of part of readers-vocabulary's body (a corruption in the upstream file, not
authored content of pr-template-honest-gates's own (practice: pr-template-honest-gates) — see FIXUP_39_MARKER below and
spec/PRACTICE_FORMAT.md). That duplicate is dropped, precisely and only
there, and the byte-identical-regeneration check treats exactly that
removal as the one approved exception to an otherwise-exact diff.

The duplicate is pasted MID-PARAGRAPH — it begins mid-word on the line
immediately after pr-template-honest-gates's own "**Install.**" paragraph ends, with no
blank line between — so the drop must begin at the marker itself. An
earlier version walked back to the preceding blank line, which deleted
pr-template-honest-gates's whole Install paragraph along with the corruption, silently
and with the harness fully green: every check compared the lossy output
against a source parsed through the same lossy fixup. The span actually
dropped is now recorded on each parsed practice as `dropped_corruption`,
and verify_harness.py's check_corruption_drop_is_a_duplicate asserts that
whatever is dropped occurs verbatim elsewhere in the file — a property of
the text rather than of the boundary, so it fails on an over-broad drop.

Run:
  python3 tools/split_practices.py split           # PRACTICES.md -> practices/*.md
                                                    # (refuses if practices/ is non-empty;
                                                    # see cmd_split's docstring comment --
                                                    # pass --force for a deliberate redo)
  python3 tools/split_practices.py build            > /tmp/PRACTICES.rebuilt.md
  python3 tools/split_practices.py build --diff      # compare rebuild vs PRACTICES.md

NOTE on `build --diff`: it used to be expected to come back empty, and
verify_harness.py gated on that. It no longer is. The phase-1.5 editorial
re-split (tools/resplit_sections.py) moves text between Rule/Why/Story/
Install, which moves where this command re-emits each "**Why.**" label, so
a non-empty diff is now the normal output and shows the re-split rather than
a defect. What proves the practice files still hold exactly BestPractice's
content is verify_harness.py's sentence-for-sentence check against
PRACTICES.md, which is stronger than this diff ever was and does not care
how the sections are divided.
