"""doc_lint.py — markdown hygiene checks (practice: doc-references-are-links).

Markdown hygiene checks, each born from a real bug (an outward-facing document
that rendered with unintended strikethrough; file references written as bare
backticks instead of links; a link converted to an HTML anchor for new-tab
behavior that GitHub silently neutered):

  1. ACCIDENTAL STRIKETHROUGH (error). GitHub renders `~text~` and `~~text~~` as
     <del> when the tildes flank properly. A lone `~` used for "approximately"
     (`~$5k`) is HARMLESS (it only ever *opens*, never closes) — the bug is when
     two tildes on a line pair into a strikethrough span. Detected EXACTLY with
     GitHub's own engine (cmark-gfm): a line is flagged only if it actually
     renders <del> AND does not use `~~` (double-tilde is treated as intentional
     strikethrough). Fix: use `≈` for "approximately", or --fix.

  2. UNLINKED FILE REFERENCE (warning). A backticked `*.md`/`*.py` filename that
     is not the text of a markdown link. Per the doc-reference convention, new
     text links its references. Warning-only (index docs legitimately carry many
     bare-backtick references); shown so you can link the ones you just touched.

  3. UNGLOSSED ACRONYM (warning) (practice: acronyms-glossary). If the repo has a GLOSSARY.md, this
     flags ALL-CAPS tokens in a changed doc that are NOT in it, not defined inline
     on the same line as `(TOKEN)`, and not a common word/unit — so you either
     expand the acronym on first use or add it to the glossary. Warning-only,
     deduped to one line per acronym; skipped entirely if there is no GLOSSARY.md
     (a repo without one opts out naturally).

  4. BROKEN RELATIVE LINK (error). A relative markdown link whose target does
     not exist, resolved from the linking FILE's own directory (not the repo
     root — the mistake that produced 96 of them here, in files one level
     down). A target carrying a `#fragment` is checked twice: the file must
     exist, and the fragment must match a heading in it -- GitHub's own slug
     rule, so `## Cost — the numbers` is `#cost--the-numbers`, two hyphens,
     because the dash is deleted and both of its spaces survive. Skips fenced
     blocks, code spans and URLs; skips templates/ and deck/, whose links
     deliberately name a tree that is not this repo's.

  5. HTML ANCHOR WITH target= (warning). GitHub's sanitizer strips target=
     (and most other attributes) from raw HTML anchors in rendered markdown,
     so an "open in new tab" link silently does nothing there (as of 2026-08;
     origin: a thread spent two commits adding target="_blank" and reverting
     it). Use a plain markdown link instead.

  7. FRONTMATTER NOT VALID YAML (error). A --- fence this repo's own,
     more forgiving reader accepts but a real YAML parser (PyYAML) rejects
     -- most often a title with a second, unquoted colon, which PyYAML reads
     as opening a nested mapping. Whole-file, not line-scoped: a bad fence is
     a property of the frontmatter block, not of one line inside it. Shares
     its parser with verify_harness.py's deep-check version of the same
     check (frontmatter_yaml.py) so a fix lands once. Skipped with a notice
     where PyYAML isn't installed, same as check 1 when cmark-gfm is absent.

SCOPE: by default, only files CHANGED vs the default branch (the convention is
"fix the parts you touch"; this also avoids editing frozen documents, where a
`~`→`≈` change would be content drift). Pass explicit files, or --all to scan
the whole tree (reports the legacy backlog; does not fail).
Explicit paths are resolved against the REPO ROOT and must exist — a path that
resolves to nothing is a hard error, not a skip (origin: a fixture outside the
repo was "checked", scanned nothing, and reported OK).
Frozen-document artifacts (name prefixes in FROZEN_PREFIXES, per repo) are
excluded from the default and --all selections — they are immutable records,
so a lint hit on one is unfixable by design (origin: committing a frozen
record failed the gate on its own internal `~` tildes). Passing one
explicitly still scans it.

Requires cmark-gfm for exact detection:  pip install cmarkgfm
(If absent, the strikethrough check is SKIPPED with a notice rather than guessing.)

# and templates/ is full of those: a template's prose links up and out of
# itself into this repo's own documents, and `../../INSTALL.md` is this repo's
# INSTALL.md for every reader of the raw template. When the destination
# resolves, no "it means the instantiated tree" reading saves a fragment that
# names no heading in it -- the reader lands at the top of the right document
# and nobody reports it.
#
# THE INCIDENT (practice: cite-the-incident). templates/document-project/
# README.md linked INSTALL.md's old "#1-installing-into-a-repo-that-already-
# has-its-own-process" after that heading was reworded to "## 1. Install Into
# a Dependent Repo". Every other reference in the tree was repointed with the
# rename; this one was not, because it sits under templates/ where the link
# check returned [] before reading a single link. It was found on 2026-09-11
# by a person reading the template, from a consuming repo -- which is not a
# mechanism (practice: convention-to-audit). Measured when this split was
# written: six fragment links under templates/ resolve to a real file here,
# one of them broken, and zero links anywhere in the tree carry a fragment
# INTO templates/ -- so this costs one finding and no false positives.
#
# deck/ and evals/ deliberately stay wholly exempt. An eval's frozen snapshot
# is the case this must not touch: a stale anchor there is correct history,
# and the fix a gate would demand is rewriting the evidence.

# A reader-facing document looks like its finished output; audit apparatus,
# decision provenance, verification bookkeeping, and history lore live in the
# paired record doc (*_diligence.md / *_record.md / *_decision.md), linked
# once. Origin: a flagship study in the first dependent repo accreted a
# claims-to-source table, a verification record, an unattributed "user
# decision", and menu-retirement lore -- the fourth recurrence of the same
# leak -- and the written rule alone had not held; the owner asked for the
# mechanical guard. Companion rule: an inclination to write a verify-later
# flag means GO VERIFY NOW; only an externally-blocked item may remain open,
# in the record's open tail.

# `decisions` is here for the same reason `practices` and `spec` are: a dated
# decision record IS the apparatus this check routes things into, so linting
# one as a deliverable flags it for containing exactly its own subject matter.

# not a document at all, it is a RECORD of what a model was shown. Its prompts
# quote the practice catalogue verbatim -- including the catalogue's own words
# about claims-to-source tables and verification records -- so a residue check
# reads the QUOTED text as this repo's own apparatus. Editing the quote to
# satisfy the check would change what the model was shown and invalidate the

# the searcher uses the vocabulary of HOW the thing works, so each search
# returns a clean, complete-looking result set with the other half absent.
#
# "Search both vocabularies" is advice a hurried reader skips. What is
# mechanically checkable is the weaker but durable property: a document
# carrying generated numbers should be reachable from at least one index a
# reader actually consults. That does not force the right search, but it
# guarantees the target of that search exists somewhere findable.

# Configure INDEX_FILES for the host repo's own index documents. Scoped like
# every other check here -- gate on what you touched, --all reports the
# backlog, so a legacy corpus never blocks.
# This repo's index documents. AGENTS.md carries the quick index a
# session actually consults; MAP.md is generated from the practices and
# indexes those, so a spec document is reachable only through the quick index.

# index was split that day, with the dozen rows sessions reach for constantly
# left in AGENTS.md and the other 76 moved there (practice: reduction-pass,

# spec/ENFORCEMENT.md, spec/CHANGES_TO_TELL_ALEX.md and

# mirror that is deliberately on hold. Reported loudly, counted separately,
# never fatal -- practice fail-gracefully: keep going, and tell the person.

# hardcoding the answer got it wrong for half the install models. The literal
# below is INSTALL.md §1's layout. A §0 install mirrors somewhere else
# entirely -- the vendored catalogue sits at whatever path precedent.json's
# `universal` source names -- so a §0 consumer taking a routine catalogue
# update went red on 109 broken relative links, every one of them inside a
# mirror and pointing at a file that exists upstream and not in the consumer.
