"""precedent_reply_check.py — the reply gate, made BLOCKING.

WHAT THIS IS FOR. Every other channel in this engine is advisory: the
resident block, the occasion index, the path triggers and
tools/precedent_gate.py all put a rule in front of a session and hope. For
rules about how a REPLY is written that hope is measurably thin, because the
one artifact they govern -- the conversation transcript -- is the one thing
no repo-scoped check has ever read. Morgan, 2026-09-13, on the closing
Next Steps list his own individual set has required since 2026-09-04: *"I
feel like it sometimes does that, sometimes doesn't, how can we force
that?"*

It is forceable, and the reason nobody had forced it was a false premise
written into the practice's own `## Install` section: that the transcript is
unreachable. It is not. Claude Code hands a Stop hook a JSON payload on
stdin carrying `transcript_path`, and that file is the session's own JSONL
log, final assistant message included, on disk, before the hook runs
(measured here that day). A Stop hook exiting 2 sends its stderr back to the
model and the turn continues -- so a reply that broke the rule is rewritten
before the person ever sees it. That is enforcement, not a reminder.

WHAT IT CHECKS, AND WHY NOT ONE WORD OF IT IS IN THIS FILE. Nothing here
says how a reply should end. The engine ships the MECHANISM, and every
source declares its own requirements, in a `reply_check.json` at the source
root. The shape, with an invented requirement so the example is not
mistaken for a live declaration:

    {
      "practice": "<the slug this enforces>",
      "require_heading_matching": "what I need from you",
      "require_one_of": ["Nothing is blocked", "Blocked on:"],
      "require_no_contradiction": [
        {"if_says": "Nothing is blocked",
         "must_not_say_matching": "still (waiting|open|pending)"}
      ],
      "require_no_bare_pattern": [
        {"pattern": "\\bPR #\\d+\\b",
         "why": "a pull request number names a page with a destination"}
      ],
      "why": "<what goes wrong when the reply omits it>"
    }

`require_no_contradiction` is a narrower kind of check than the other two --
it never judges whether a verdict sentence is the RIGHT one (unreachable
from a repo-scoped script, per the-boildown's own Install section), only
whether the reply asserts it in the same breath as a plain-language phrase
that means the opposite. Added 2026-09-20 after exactly that: a reply said
"nothing is blocking" and then closed with "Don't archive this session".

`require_no_bare_pattern` checks a different practice family entirely --
rule-links and branch-links, both of which say a mentioned destination (a
PR, a session, a branch, a rule) gets a link the first time it is named, and
neither of which had a mechanical check before this. Each entry is a
`{pattern, why}` pair; every markdown link (`[text](url)`) in the reply is
stripped out FIRST, and each pattern is then tested against what remains --
a match there is a mention that never appeared inside a link at all. Because
the strip happens once, up front, a thing linked on its first mention and
named bare again later in the same reply still matches, which is a known
imprecision (rule-links only requires the FIRST mention to be linked) rather
than a bug -- see this repo's own reply_check.json, which declares this
predicate `advisory` for exactly that reason. Added 2026-09-20 after a bare
"PR #21" in a chat reply went unlinked and uncaught in a downstream
consumer.

A source may declare one requirement (an object) or several (a list). Add
`"advisory": true` to a requirement and an unmet one is still detected and
named (by `violations()`, to whoever reads `--explain` or calls this
programmatically) but never enters the blocking set `main()` acts on --
so it can never refuse a turn. That is the one way this file's mechanism
stops being "enforcement, not a reminder" for a specific requirement,
deliberately: a source declares `advisory` when it wants the SHAPE of a
recommendation -- reviewed, stated one way or the other -- without the
gate that gave next-steps-after-commit its teeth. (the-boildown's own
compact-check and archive-line requirements are the first to use it,
2026-09-17.)

THAT SPLIT IS STILL THE POINT, AND ONE REQUIREMENT HAS SINCE CROSSED IT.
`next-steps-after-commit` -- the closing `## Next Steps` heading and one of
two session-disposition sentences -- was an INDIVIDUAL practice when this
file was written, and this docstring used it as the worked example of
something the engine must not compile into itself: binding every adopter of
Precedent to one person's reply convention is exactly the reach mistake
practices/rule-level-by-reach exists to stop. Morgan moved it to universal
on 2026-09-14 (*"I think we should move the next steps at the end to be
universal"*), so it is now declared in THIS repository's own
reply_check.json and does bind every adopter -- deliberately, and said out
loud in the pull request that moved it rather than left to be discovered.

That changes which source declares one requirement. It changes nothing
about the mechanism: this file still has no requirement of its own, reads
every source's declaration the same way, and a repo where no source
declares one checks nothing and says nothing. A source that wants different
wording than the universal declaration has no override key yet; that is
real follow-up work, not a property of the split.

WHAT A REQUIREMENT MAY BE CONDITIONED ON. `require_when_context_grew_tokens`
makes a requirement fire only once the conversation has grown by that many
tokens since the sentence was last said -- which is how the universal
compaction offer is enforced without becoming a line on every reply. The
size is read from the transcript's own `usage` records, and it decides
WHETHER THE OFFER IS OWED, never anything about compacting: the person still
answers it. That is deliberate, and it is the clause
practices/session-spend-follows-the-task.md already carried -- how full the
context is picks which boundary you speak at, never whether the choice is
yours to take.

A repo where no source declares one checks nothing and says nothing. That is
the honest default: this file enforces rules somebody wrote down, and has no
opinion of its own about how a reply should end.

    """-> True when the reply has deliberately given up the unsafe work.

    Two routes, and each still needs its own naming half -- a session that
    has not looked at a clone cannot name it, and one that has can say so in
    the same breath as giving it up. The naming half is what keeps either
    route from being a password.

    ROUTE 1, THE MARKER (checked first). `unless_reply_declares_loss.marker`
    is a regex template with a literal `{name}` placeholder; a reply passes
    this route only when EVERY unsafe checkout has its own matching line, so
    "precedent-individual" cannot cover for a second unsafe checkout the
    reply never mentions. This is the one the archive line's own author is
    meant to reach for: a structured `**Checkout disposition:** NAME --
    discard (reason)` line, greppable, and never mistaken for prose that
    merely happens to contain one of route 2's phrases (a quoted objection,
    a description of someone else's reply) the way free text can be.

    ROUTE 2, THE PHRASE LIST (kept for prose that says the same thing in
    Morgan's own words rather than the marker). The reply says one of the
    rule's declared phrases, ANYWHERE, and also names every unsafe checkout
    anywhere in the same reply -- looser than route 1's per-checkout
    pairing, which is why route 1 exists at all: a session naming two
    checkouts and giving up only one could pass route 2 by accident. Route 1
    is preferred for exactly that reason; route 2 stays for backward
    compatibility with replies that already read correctly under the old
    rule.

    Matching is on the checkout's directory name (`precedent-individual`),
    not its full path, because that is what a reply to a person actually
    writes. An unreadable or unrunnable scanner returns False -- the same
