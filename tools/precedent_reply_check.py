"""precedent_reply_check.py — the reply gate, made BLOCKING.

WHAT THIS IS FOR. Every other channel in this engine is advisory: the
resident block, the occasion index, the path triggers and
tools/precedent_gate.py all put a rule in front of a session and hope. For
rules about how a REPLY is written that hope is measurably thin, because the
one artifact they govern -- the conversation transcript -- is the one thing
no repo-scoped check has ever read. Morgan, 2026-09-13, on the closing
Next Steps list his own individual set has required since 2026-09-04: *"I
feel like it sometimes does that, sometimes doesn't, how can we force
that?"*

It is forceable, and the reason nobody had forced it was a false premise
written into the practice's own `## Install` section: that the transcript is
unreachable. It is not. Claude Code hands a Stop hook a JSON payload on
stdin carrying `transcript_path`, and that file is the session's own JSONL
log, final assistant message included, on disk, before the hook runs
(measured here that day). A Stop hook exiting 2 sends its stderr back to the
model and the turn continues -- so a reply that broke the rule is rewritten
before the person ever sees it. That is enforcement, not a reminder.

WHAT IT CHECKS, AND WHY NOT ONE WORD OF IT IS IN THIS FILE. Nothing here
says how a reply should end. The engine ships the MECHANISM, and every
source declares its own requirements, in a `reply_check.json` at the source
root. The shape, with an invented requirement so the example is not
mistaken for a live declaration:

    {
      "practice": "<the slug this enforces>",
      "require_heading_matching": "what I need from you",
      "require_one_of": ["Nothing is blocked", "Blocked on:"],
      "why": "<what goes wrong when the reply omits it>"
    }

A source may declare one requirement (an object) or several (a list). Add
`"advisory": true` to a requirement and an unmet one is still detected and
named (by `violations()`, to whoever reads `--explain` or calls this
programmatically) but never enters the blocking set `main()` acts on --
so it can never refuse a turn. That is the one way this file's mechanism
stops being "enforcement, not a reminder" for a specific requirement,
deliberately: a source declares `advisory` when it wants the SHAPE of a
recommendation -- reviewed, stated one way or the other -- without the
gate that gave next-steps-after-commit its teeth. (the-boildown's own
compact-check and archive-line requirements are the first to use it,
2026-09-17.)

THAT SPLIT IS STILL THE POINT, AND ONE REQUIREMENT HAS SINCE CROSSED IT.
`next-steps-after-commit` -- the closing `## Next Steps` heading and one of
two session-disposition sentences -- was an INDIVIDUAL practice when this
file was written, and this docstring used it as the worked example of
something the engine must not compile into itself: binding every adopter of
Precedent to one person's reply convention is exactly the reach mistake
practices/rule-level-by-reach exists to stop. Morgan moved it to universal
on 2026-09-14 (*"I think we should move the next steps at the end to be
universal"*), so it is now declared in THIS repository's own
reply_check.json and does bind every adopter -- deliberately, and said out
loud in the pull request that moved it rather than left to be discovered.

That changes which source declares one requirement. It changes nothing
about the mechanism: this file still has no requirement of its own, reads
every source's declaration the same way, and a repo where no source
declares one checks nothing and says nothing. A source that wants different
wording than the universal declaration has no override key yet; that is
real follow-up work, not a property of the split.

WHAT A REQUIREMENT MAY BE CONDITIONED ON. `require_when_context_grew_tokens`
makes a requirement fire only once the conversation has grown by that many
tokens since the sentence was last said -- which is how the universal
compaction offer is enforced without becoming a line on every reply. The
size is read from the transcript's own `usage` records, and it decides
WHETHER THE OFFER IS OWED, never anything about compacting: the person still
answers it. That is deliberate, and it is the clause
practices/session-spend-follows-the-task.md already carried -- how full the
context is picks which boundary you speak at, never whether the choice is
yours to take.

A repo where no source declares one checks nothing and says nothing. That is
the honest default: this file enforces rules somebody wrote down, and has no
opinion of its own about how a reply should end.
