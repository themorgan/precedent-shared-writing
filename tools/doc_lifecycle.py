"""The document status header — kind, status, supersession — checked across spec/ and record/

doc_lifecycle.py -- the document status header, checked.

Implements the mechanical check spec/DOCUMENT_LIFECYCLE.md's "The mechanical
check" section specifies. Every document under spec/ (and record/, once that
exists) carries YAML frontmatter saying what KIND of document it is and what
STATE it is in, so a reader knows in three seconds whether they are holding a
plan, a procedure, or the record of something that already happened.

WHY A KIND AND NOT JUST A DATE. The kind decides what "outdated" can even
mean for a file. A `reference` states how the system works and can become
wrong. A `record` is a true observation of a date and stays true forever --
spec/LOADER.md's "52 practices" is not stale, it is the condition a
measurement ran under. Marking both with the same freshness idea is what
makes a reader distrust the wrong one.

practice: checkable-gets-checked -- this convention is straightforwardly
checkable, so it is not left advisory.

BLOCKING SINCE PHASE 2 (2026-09-07), when the backfill stamped all 24 spec
documents. An unstamped file is now a failure. `--warn-only` restores the
phase-1 behaviour -- report unstamped files, exit 0 -- which is what a repo
part-way through its own backfill wants, and is the mode this check was
introduced in so that a standard could be registered and read before any
tree satisfied it. Failing 22 files on the commit that introduces a
convention makes the convention something to switch off rather than satisfy.
