"""precedent_push_check.py -- run, before a push, what CI used to run after it.

WHY THIS EXISTS (Morgan, 2026-09-25, strength: decided). Three switches now
keep GitHub Actions from running on most of his pushes: `ci_workflows`
(no workflow installed), `ci_every_hours` and `ci_on_branches` (a `[skip
ci]` line on the commit, spec/CI_CADENCE_PLAN.md). And since 2026-09-21 a
practice source runs no CI at all (practice: source-sets-run-no-ci). Every
one of those decisions was argued on the same premise -- "the local check
runs before the push, so CI is a second opinion" -- and nothing ran the
local check. It was a sentence in AGENTS.md and in go-update's Rule. His
ask, on being shown that: "it should be the same list of everything we
used to run (just locally we do it, not via the github ci/cd)."

So this is that list, per kind of repository, and one command that runs
all of it. `push-check-gate.sh` (templates/harness/claude-code/hooks/) calls
it with `--gate` before a session's `git push`, and refuses the push on a
failure. Nothing here depends on any one agent harness; the hook is the
thin Claude Code adapter, and any other harness runs this file directly.

WHAT "EVERYTHING WE USED TO RUN" MEANS, kind by kind. Each entry names the
workflow it replaces, so the next person to retire or add a workflow can
see where its local twin lives:

  upstream   BestPractice itself: .github/workflows/deep-check.yml
             (verify_harness, precedent_check, doc_sync), leak-gate.yml,
             and the retired docs.yml (doc_lint). This is also AGENTS.md's
             own "deep check" list, word for word.
  source     a practice set: the retired precedent-check.yml
             (precedent_check, plus its views-drift job, build_views
             --check), leak-gate.yml and doc-lint.yml. Its commit-identity
             steps already moved to commit-identity-push-gate.sh on
             2026-09-21 and are not repeated here.
  consumer   a repo that installs Precedent: leak-gate.yml, light-check.yml
             (precedent_check) and the retired bestpractice-docs.yml
             (doc_lint).

Two deliberate departures from what CI ran, both stronger rather than
weaker. precedent_check runs `--full-sweep`: bare, it runs only this diff's
checks plus a one-in-ten rotation, which is the trap every source set's
AGENTS.md warns about, and a sweep costs seconds. And leak_gate runs whole,
not `--structural-only`: CI could only run the structural half because it
never had the private blocklist, and a local run does.

THE DEEP CHECK'S OWN SUITE RUNS TOO, wherever a repo has one. A set that
maintains check scripts under tools/checks/ keeps a two-direction test for
each and a driver, tools/checks/tests/run_all.sh, that runs them all --
the mechanical half of its `deep-check` practice, in that practice's own
words. No workflow ever ran it; it was run by hand, or not. Morgan,
2026-09-25: "We had a deep_check too." The first run found five of one
set's cases red, fixed the same day. A repo with no driver skips the entry
and says so.

AND IN A PRACTICE SOURCE, RUNS IT A SECOND TIME SHAPED LIKE A CONSUMER.
Those tests ship: every repository that resolves the source runs them
against its own tree. precedent_consumer_shape.py runs the suite again with
git ignoring what a typical consuming repository ignores, so a test that
passes only in its home layout goes red here instead of there. 2026-09-25:
one test staged a fixture under vendor/ with a plain `git add`, passed on
every run in its source, and failed for days in a consumer that ignores
vendor/, where nobody could fix it.

A SHALLOW CLONE IS DEEPENED FIRST, or the push is refused. Every clone in
a cloud session starts shallow, and a check that walks `git log` over a
shallow clone reports SKIPPED -- which this list would then call a pass.
Measured 2026-09-25: all five of that day's clones were shallow, and a
history check in one set had been skipping on every run. `git fetch
--unshallow` took one to five seconds each.

A PASS IS RECORDED AGAINST THE TREE, so the gate does not run the suite
twice. After a clean run with nothing uncommitted, the HEAD tree's hash
goes into .git/precedent-push-check.json. `--gate` finds that record and
exits at once, which is what makes "run the deep check, then push" cost one
run rather than two (practice: slow-steps-report-and-cache). The record
is keyed on the tree and the check list together, so any change to either
invalidates it, and it lives in the git directory, never in the tracked
tree.

AND THE PASS IS SHARED WITH EVERY CHECKOUT (Morgan, 2026-09-25, strength:
decided). The record above lives in one checkout, and a person working in
many windows has one checkout per window: a full run in one window was
invisible to the Promote said in another, which ran the whole suite again
on files it had already passed. So a recorded pass is also published to
origin as a small receipt on the branch precedent-check-receipts --
receipts/<check list>/<tree>.json, naming the files by hash and carrying
none of them, so it publishes no unpushed work. `--gate` fetches that
branch when this checkout has no record of its own. The trade, said
plainly: anyone who can push to origin can write one, and every checkout
then believes it. Only this file writes them, and only after every check
passed -- the trust the local record already asked for, now reaching every
window instead of one. PRECEDENT_NO_SHARED_PASS=1 turns
both halves off.

TWO TIERS, BY BRANCH (spec/BRANCH_TIERS_PLAN.md, Morgan, 2026-09-25,
strength: decided). A push to staging or main runs every check below -- the
FULL tier. A push to pre-staging or any other branch runs only the BASIC
tier: the markdown lint, the leak gate (pushing any branch of a public
repository publishes it) and the commit-author checks, seconds rather than
minutes. The person's `branch_push_checks` setting can raise the other
branches to full; nothing lowers staging or main. Which branch gets which
lives in precedent_branches.py, not here. A full pass satisfies a basic
gate; a basic pass never satisfies a full one.

Run:
  python3 tools/precedent_push_check.py                  # every check, record a pass
  python3 tools/precedent_push_check.py --tier basic     # the basic tier only
  python3 tools/precedent_push_check.py --gate           # skip if this tree passed
  python3 tools/precedent_push_check.py --gate --push-command 'origin pre-staging'
                                  # the tier that push needs (what the hook runs)
  python3 tools/precedent_push_check.py --list           # what would run, and why

Exit status: 0 everything passed; 1 a check failed; 2 nothing could be run
(not a git checkout, or a repository of no kind this file knows).
