"""The one matcher for the five-stage ladder's own words -- step labels, the release commands, the branch tiers, links to the ladder set's practices -- used by the check that keeps them out of everything outside that set and by the tests that hold engine output to the same (spec/LADDER_OPT_IN_PLAN.md D7)

ladder_words.py -- the one matcher for the five-stage ladder's own words
(spec/LADDER_OPT_IN_PLAN.md D7, "Check E").

The ladder is a working method a person opts into by bringing the set that
provides it. Its words -- the stage labels, the release commands, the branch
tiers -- belong in that set and nowhere a person off the ladder reads. This
module says which words those are, once, so the check that holds the
rule-bearing files to it and the tests that hold engine OUTPUT to it cannot
disagree.

    python3 tools/ladder_words.py FILE...      # print every hit, exit 1 if any
    python3 tools/ladder_words.py --repo .     # the files Check E scopes

STRICT words only. "Consider", "Act" and "Produce" are ordinary English and
never match on their own, nor does a lowercase "brainstorm"; a stage name
counts only beside its step label, and a command only when it is quoted or
bold, the way a command is written. A record -- todo/, record/, spec/, a
gotcha or practice's ## Story, WHATS_NEW.md -- says what happened and may
use any word; it is never in scope.
