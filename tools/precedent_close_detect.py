"""Stage 1's trigger — at the close of a session that merged and is ready to archive, offers at most one practice candidate found in that session's own material

precedent_close_detect.py — the one moment a session offers a practice.

WHAT THIS IS FOR. PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md puts the automation "at the two
ends: the system notices, and the system enforces." Enforcement got built
out heavily. Noticing got tools/precedent_detect.py and no trigger — nothing
in this codebase called it, so every practice that landed arrived because
Morgan said something (spec/PRACTICE_DETECTION.md has the evidence: two
candidate files ever, both dated to the day the pipeline was built). This is
the trigger.

WHERE IT FIRES, AND WHY NOWHERE ELSE. Morgan, 2026-09-14, set the shape:
*"only when there was a merge (if there wasn't, we were just talking!)"*,
*"only explicitly when we also say 'You can archive this session'"*, one per
session, *"I don't want to DISTRACT people working on something to propose
practices."* So all of these must hold, and each is measured rather than
assumed:

  1. this session MERGED something (the transcript's own tool calls say so);
  2. the reply being written says the session is ready to archive;
  3. no reply this session has already carried a candidate — the cap;
  4. a Stage-1 detector found something in THIS session's own material.

Condition 4 is what keeps it from becoming noise, and it is the reason this
blocks rather than prints: a Stop hook's stdout does not reach the model, so
an advisory print at this moment reaches nobody (the same finding that put
the reply gate's brief in a UserPromptSubmit hook). Blocking on positive
evidence only means a session with nothing to offer is never interrupted,
and never asked to say so either.

WHAT IT NEVER DOES. It does not decide that something IS a practice — it
names what it found and the session judges, which is Stage 1 handing Stage 2
a candidate and nothing more. A session that reads the signal and concludes
it was a one-off says that in one line; inventing a rule to satisfy a hook
is the failure mode this is written to avoid, and the message says so.

WHAT IS DECLARED RATHER THAN COMPILED IN. "You can archive this session" is
ONE PERSON'S closing convention, from his individual set — compiling it into
the universal engine would bind every adopter of Precedent to it, which is
the reach mistake practices/rule-level-by-reach exists to stop, and exactly
the split tools/precedent_reply_check.py already makes. So the engine ships
the mechanism and each source declares its own phrases in a
`close_detect.json` at the source root:

    {
      "practice": "merged-session-offers-a-practice",
      "archive_ready_one_of": ["You can archive this session"],
      "closing_heading_matching": "next step",
      "candidate_marker": "Practice candidate",
      "why": "so a finished session offers what it learned, once"
    }

A repo where no source declares one detects nothing and blocks nothing.

Run:
  <stop hook> | python3 tools/precedent_close_detect.py   # the real path
  python3 tools/precedent_close_detect.py --explain       # what is declared
