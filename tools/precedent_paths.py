"""precedent_paths.py — the path-triggered loading channel
(PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md, "How an Agent Knows Which Practices to Load":
"A PreToolUse hook matches the edited file against every practice's
applies_to globs and prints the matching ## Rule sections.").

Given one or more file paths (the files a tool is about to touch), prints
the ## Rule section of every on-demand practice whose applies_to glob
matches at least one of them. Resident practices are never printed here —
they are already in context via the generated AGENTS.md block — and a
practice matching only "**" is not printed either, since applies_to: ["**"]
means "no narrower-than-everything scope", not "route this on every touch"
(reachability for those practices comes from checked_by or occasion instead;
see spec/PRACTICE_FORMAT.md).

This is deliberately the same code path a PreToolUse hook shells out to and
that tools/behavioral_replay.py drives against historical commits, per the
plan's "one code path" principle for the loader (Loading a Practice Means
Loading Its Rule, Not Its File).

Run:
  python3 tools/precedent_paths.py FILE [FILE...]
  python3 tools/precedent_paths.py --matches-only FILE [FILE...]
      -- print only "slug: file" pairs, no Rule text (used by
         behavioral_replay.py, which only needs to know what matched)
  python3 tools/precedent_paths.py --repo DIR FILE [FILE...]
      -- match against DIR's practices/ instead of this repo's own
  python3 tools/precedent_paths.py --seen-file PATH FILE [FILE...]
      -- print a practice's full Rule the FIRST time this session matches
         it, and a one-line reminder every time after. PATH is a
         session-scoped scratch file this tool appends slugs to; a missing
         or unreadable one just means "nothing seen yet", never an error.

WHY --seen-file EXISTS. Measured on this repo, 2026-09-06: an edit to any
markdown file matches ten on-demand practices and prints ~1,000 words of
Rule text. A session that edits thirty markdown files was being handed the
same ~1,000 words thirty times -- around forty thousand tokens of exact
duplication, in a mechanism whose entire purpose is to spend context
carefully. The Rules do not change between the first edit and the
thirtieth; only the reminder that they apply is worth repeating, and a
slug plus its one-line clause is that reminder. The full text stays one
`precedent_show.py SLUG` away, and the reminder names the slug precisely
so that call is easy to make.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- matching
# `applies_to` globs are repo-root-relative and use the recursive-glob
# convention the plan's own examples assume ("**", "**/*.md",
# "book/CHAPTER1.md"): `**` crosses directory separators, a single `*` and
# `?` do not.
#
# This used to be a bare fnmatch.fnmatch(path, glob), which is WRONG for
# both halves of that, and wrong in the direction that loses practices
# silently. fnmatch has no `**`: it expands every `*` to ".*", so
# "**/*.md" becomes ".*.*/.*\.md" -- which REQUIRES a literal "/" and
# therefore never matches a top-level file. Editing AGENTS.md, README.md,
# TODO.md, PRACTICES.md or any other root document surfaced ZERO of the
# eight document practices scoped to "**/*.md". Worse, the same file
# spelled "./AGENTS.md" DID match, so the answer depended on how the path
# was typed. Measured over this repo's own history, that silently dropped
# 520 (practice, commit) instances across 65 of 86 commits -- and it is
# precisely the failure the plan names as this design's real weak point:
# "a practice with a wrong or missing trigger is worse than one buried in
# a wall of text, because nobody notices its absence."
