"""precedent_gate.py — the GATE-TRIGGERED loading channel.

PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md, "How an Agent Knows Which Practices to Load", names
four channels. This is the last one to be built:

    **Gate-triggered.** Runbook steps cite slugs; reaching the step loads
    them. A merge loads exactly the merge practices, at the moment of merging.

WHY IT HAD TO EXIST, measured rather than assumed. After phase 4's glob pass,
24 of the 46 on-demand practices still carry `applies_to: ["**"]`, and
tools/routing_scope.json records a reason for every one. A recurring reason:
**the practice fires at a moment, not in a place.** `merge-runbook` fires when
merging. `mistakes-become-rules` — the largest prose-only miss in the routing
eval, judged applicable in nine cases and found in five — fires when a review
turns up a defect. No glob reaches a moment, however well written, and the
plan forbids tuning the occasion index to compensate. A gate is the channel
those practices were always supposed to have.

WHAT THIS CHANNEL DOES AND DOES NOT PROMISE. Reach here is deterministic: if
the gate is invoked, the practice's Rule is in context, with no session
judgment involved. That is strictly stronger than the occasion index, which
requires a session to recognise the occasion, read a one-line clause, and
choose to open it. What it moves rather than solves is the question of
**whether the gate gets invoked** — a wiring problem, not a routing one.

A 2026-09-04 gate audit applied the same skepticism phase 4 applied to
`checked_by` (see spec/ENFORCEMENT.md's "What phase 4 found before it built
anything") to this channel, and found the identical failure class once:
`push` and `reply`
are the only two gates with an actual invocation point anywhere in this
repo's templates (a git pre-push hook, a Claude Code Stop hook — the only
two adapter mechanisms that exist to interrupt a session at all; see
templates/harness/README.md's table). `push` was wired, into
templates/hooks/pre-push. `reply` was not: routing_scope.json's own
vocabulary names its moment as "the stop hook", and
templates/harness/claude-code/hooks/stop-git-check.sh — the only stop-hook
script any adapter ships — never called this file. The claim and the wiring
had drifted apart, unnoticed, the same way seven of eight `checked_by`
claims had. It is fixed now (both that template and this repo's own
`.claude/hooks/stop-git-check.sh`), and `check_gate_channel` in
tools/verify_harness.py asserts it stays fixed, the same way it already
asserted `push`'s wiring.

`merge` and `review` remain cited only — by runbook steps and by the
standing instruction in the loader block — and that is not a TODO to close,
it is this channel's honest, permanent shape: no adapter here has a
merge-time or review-time hook to interrupt a session the way Stop and
pre-push do, so there is nothing to wire. Weaker than `push`/`reply`, and
worth staying plain about rather than counting as solved.

**The routing eval cannot measure any of this.** It simulates the resident
block, the occasion index and the path channel against twenty commits; a gate
fires at a moment a commit does not record. No recall figure anywhere should
be attributed to this channel.

Run:

    registered to `gate` in any source this repo resolves -- team,
    individual and repo-local as well as universal -- as (slug, level,
    source_name, path) tuples.

    `unresolved_level` is what the CALLER should assume for a practice that
    sits in this repo's own `practices/` and is registered to `gate`, but
    that `entries` above does not otherwise account for -- either because
    resolution failed outright or because the source that owns it did not
    resolve this session. It is `'universal'` when this repo's own
    precedent.json declares no external universal source, which is what
    makes that assumption safe: a repo that names nothing at `level:
    universal` is not consuming one, so by elimination its own tree IS the
    universal catalogue (BestPractice's own shape). It is `None` -- "level
    unknown, ask the caller not to assert one" -- the moment this repo DOES
    declare an external universal source, because then its own
    `practices/` is an individual, team or shared source's tree instead,
    and this function has no way to say which one from a file that never
    resolved. Reproduced 2026-09-22 in precedent-individual (see this
    module's `main()`): `so-what-test` and `handoff-only-when-blocked` are
    that set's own INDIVIDUAL practices, but with the individual source
    unresolved (no `~/.config/precedent/config.json`), the caller's old
    hardcoded `'universal'` fallback printed `(universal)` for both --
    wrong in a way nothing downstream could catch, on the one channel whose
    whole promise is that a session does not have to judge this for
    itself.

    WHY THIS EXISTS, and what it cost to leave out. Until 2026-09-13 this
    file read exactly one directory: `<root>/practices/`. In a consuming
    repo that is the materialized union of every source, so nothing was
    missing. In THIS repo -- and in any repo whose sources resolve as
    sibling clones rather than through precedent_materialize.py -- it is the
    universal catalogue alone, so a team or individual practice declaring
    `gates: ["reply"]` had no invocation point anywhere: the stop hook ran
    the gate, the gate read a directory those practices are not in, and
    printed the universal three. Measured here that day: three individual
    practices about how a reply is written (`next-steps-after-commit`,
    `closing-items-are-this-thread`, `handoff-only-when-blocked`) were
    registered to the reply gate and reached a session only through the
    one-line occasion clause in `.precedent/SESSION_PRACTICES.md` -- which
    fires only if the session recognises the occasion, which is exactly the
    "sometimes it does, sometimes it does not" Morgan reported.

    A gate is the channel whose whole promise is that reach does not depend
    on session judgment (see this module's header). A gate that serves one
    source silently keeps that promise for one level and breaks it for the
    other three.

    Failure here is never fatal: a repo with no resolvable source still gets
    its own practices/ -- the caller unions the two -- and the reason is
    NAMED rather than swallowed (practice: fail-gracefully).

    """The reply requirements a source DECLARES, printed verbatim at the

    WHY, measured 2026-09-13, the day the blocking half landed. A Stop hook
    fires after the reply has already been rendered to the person, so
    refusing the stop cannot un-render it: every refusal costs them the same
    reply twice, once wrong and once rewritten. Morgan saw that repeatedly
    within hours of the check going in -- "you posted your message to me
    twice ... many times. That never happened before."

    The refusals were not the check being wrong. They were the requirement
    arriving after the only moment it could have been applied. This channel
    fires BEFORE the reply, and it carried one-line practice clauses only --
    summaries, written by hand, which is exactly how one of them came to say
    "in bold" about a rule whose whole point is that bold is not enough. A
    summary cannot be what a mechanical check is read from; the check's own
    input can. So the literal heading pattern and the literal sentences go
    here, from the same reply_check.json the hook reads, and the block

    Silent when no source declares any, which is most repos -- and never
    fatal: a reminder that cannot be built must not take the gate down with
    it (practice: fail-gracefully).
