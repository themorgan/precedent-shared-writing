"""precedent_gate.py — the GATE-TRIGGERED loading channel.

PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md, "How an Agent Knows Which Practices to Load", names
four channels. This is the last one to be built:

    **Gate-triggered.** Runbook steps cite slugs; reaching the step loads
    them. A merge loads exactly the merge practices, at the moment of merging.

WHY IT HAD TO EXIST, measured rather than assumed. After phase 4's glob pass,
24 of the 46 on-demand practices still carry `applies_to: ["**"]`, and
tools/routing_scope.json records a reason for every one. A recurring reason:
**the practice fires at a moment, not in a place.** `merge-runbook` fires when
merging. `mistakes-become-rules` — the largest prose-only miss in the routing
eval, judged applicable in nine cases and found in five — fires when a review
turns up a defect. No glob reaches a moment, however well written, and the
plan forbids tuning the occasion index to compensate. A gate is the channel
those practices were always supposed to have.

WHAT THIS CHANNEL DOES AND DOES NOT PROMISE. Reach here is deterministic: if
the gate is invoked, the practice's Rule is in context, with no session
judgment involved. That is strictly stronger than the occasion index, which
requires a session to recognise the occasion, read a one-line clause, and
choose to open it. What it moves rather than solves is the question of
**whether the gate gets invoked** — a wiring problem, not a routing one.

A 2026-09-04 gate audit applied the same skepticism phase 4 applied to
`checked_by` (see spec/ENFORCEMENT.md's "What phase 4 found before it built
anything") to this channel, and found the identical failure class once:
`push` and `reply`
are the only two gates with an actual invocation point anywhere in this
repo's templates (a git pre-push hook, a Claude Code Stop hook — the only
two adapter mechanisms that exist to interrupt a session at all; see
templates/harness/README.md's table). `push` was wired, into
templates/hooks/pre-push. `reply` was not: routing_scope.json's own
vocabulary names its moment as "the stop hook", and
templates/harness/claude-code/hooks/stop-git-check.sh — the only stop-hook
script any adapter ships — never called this file. The claim and the wiring
had drifted apart, unnoticed, the same way seven of eight `checked_by`
claims had. It is fixed now (both that template and this repo's own
`.claude/hooks/stop-git-check.sh`), and `check_gate_channel` in
tools/verify_harness.py asserts it stays fixed, the same way it already
asserted `push`'s wiring.

`merge` and `review` remain cited only — by runbook steps and by the
standing instruction in the loader block — and that is not a TODO to close,
it is this channel's honest, permanent shape: no adapter here has a
merge-time or review-time hook to interrupt a session the way Stop and
pre-push do, so there is nothing to wire. Weaker than `push`/`reply`, and
worth staying plain about rather than counting as solved.

**The routing eval cannot measure any of this.** It simulates the resident
block, the occasion index and the path channel against twenty commits; a gate
fires at a moment a commit does not record. No recall figure anywhere should
be attributed to this channel.

Run:
  python3 tools/precedent_gate.py merge          # the Rules for that moment
  python3 tools/precedent_gate.py --list         # gates, and what each one holds
  python3 tools/precedent_gate.py --repo DIR merge
      # the Rules for that moment, from DIR's practices/ instead of this
      # repo's own

# point are a property of the engine, not of one repo's practice catalogue).

# precedent_show.py's two helpers directly -- same discipline this file
# already uses for split_practices.py, not a subprocess call (which would
# mean re-parsing precedent_show.py's own "### slug\n<body>" stdout format
# back into structured data here, solely to get a note this file can
# already print itself once it has the same two functions) and not a
