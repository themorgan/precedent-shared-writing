"""Stage 3 (phase 5) — runs a candidate against the four promotion criteria

precedent_promote.py — Stage 3 of PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md's creation
pipeline: run a candidate (spec/CANDIDATE_FORMAT.md) against the four
promotion criteria. Refuses with a named reason on any failure; on a full
pass, drafts a practice file (spec/PRACTICE_FORMAT.md shape) plus a guessed
level and reason, ready for Stage 4's approval and Stage 5's landing.

This tool NEVER writes practices/*.md itself — that is Stage 5
(precedent_land.py), which additionally hard-enforces the carry-forward
rule from "What phase 5 should carry forward": a `checked_by` claim with no
registered, tested check is refused there, not merely warned about here.

THE FOUR CRITERIA (PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md, Stage 3):
  1. Recurrence or real cost.
  2. Reachability -- a checked_by, a narrow applies_to, or an occasion.
  3. Non-duplication -- no existing practice already covers this by slug or
     substance.
  4. Budget -- a resident request must fit the 2,000-token cap.

Usage:
  precedent_promote.py --file CANDIDATE.md --level individual|team|universal
      [--against PATH[,PATH...]]   # repo roots whose practices/ to check for
                                    # duplication; defaults to the candidate's
                                    # own repo (individual/shared) plus this repo
                                    # (universal) -- see default_against()
