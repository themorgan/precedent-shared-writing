"""precedent_decommission.py — the double-check that has to pass before a
deprecated file or directory is deleted, and the deletion itself.

(practice: decommission-deletes-files)

WHY THIS EXISTS. Decommissioning a mechanism -- a scheduled workflow, a tool, a
vendored tree, a config -- leaves files behind that exist only to serve it.
Nothing forces anyone to delete them, and "leave it, it's harmless" is
always the cheaper answer in the moment, so they accumulate for years until
nobody left can say which of them still do anything. The rule
(practices/decommission-deletes-files.md) is that the files go in the same
change that decommissions the mechanism. This tool is what makes obeying it safe:
deleting on a hunch is how a live dependency gets cut, so the rule is
deliberately not "delete when you are confident" but "delete when a
mechanical audit says nothing points at it any more."

The audit REFUSES, it does not warn. There is no --force: a blocker is
either a real dependency (fix it, then re-run) or a reference that belongs
in a historical record (declare it in exempt_files). Both are edits someone
makes on purpose; neither is a flag to push past.

WHAT IT CHECKS, AND WHY EACH ONE BLOCKS.

  tracked        An untracked or already-absent path has no deletion to
                 make. Reported, never "deleted" -- claiming a no-op
                 succeeded is how a decommissioning gets recorded as done
                 without having happened.
  references     Any tracked file that still mentions the path (or its
                 basename, where that basename is distinctive enough to
                 search for) blocks. This is the same property
                 precedent_check.py's rename-updates-links enforces AFTER
                 the fact, run BEFORE it, so the deletion and the
                 repointing land in one commit rather than the check
                 failing on a branch that is already broken.
  live trigger   A .github/workflows/ file whose `on:` block still carries
                 any trigger other than workflow_dispatch blocks. A
                 decommissioning must never be the first thing that stops a
                 running job: pause the schedule, let a cycle pass, THEN
                 decommission. Deleting a live workflow means its next failure is
                 silent, and a silent absence is the failure mode this whole
                 practice exists to prevent.
  dirty          A target with uncommitted modifications blocks. Everything
                 else here is recoverable -- git history holds a deleted
                 file forever -- and uncommitted content is the one thing
                 deletion destroys outright.

A reference match is a plain substring, deliberately, so decommissioning
`docs.yml` also blocks on a line naming `bestpractice-docs.yml`. That is a
false positive in the safe direction, and tightening it to a word boundary
would trade a look at one printed line for the chance of clearing a path
something really does point at. The report prints the matching line for
exactly this reason: dismissing a wrong hit costs a second, and a wrong
clear costs a cut dependency.

WHAT IT IS BLIND TO. A reference built by string concatenation at runtime,
a path named only in something this repo does not track (a GitHub branch
protection rule, a webhook, another repo's config), and a file that nothing
references and nothing runs but that someone still needs. The audit proves
no tracked file points at the path; it cannot prove the path is useless.
That judgment stays a person's, which is why the report prints the evidence
rather than only a verdict.

Usage:
  precedent_decommission.py PATH [PATH...]            # audit only, always start here
  precedent_decommission.py PATH --reason "..." --apply
                                                     # git rm + record it
  precedent_decommission.py --list                    # what this repo has decommissioned

Exit 0 when every path audited clean (or was applied), 1 when any blocked.
