# Claude Code adapter: UserPromptSubmit hook. Install to
# .claude/hooks/reply-gate.sh (wired by the adapter's settings.json).
#
# UserPromptSubmit hook: the reply gate's practices, one line each, at the
# START of the turn.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS ALONGSIDE THE STOP HOOK. The reply gate's moment is
# "ending a turn and writing the reply", and the only adapter mechanism at
# that moment is Stop — which fires AFTER the reply is composed. Its
# advisory print has therefore never reached the reply it was about: on a
# clean exit Claude Code does not feed a Stop hook's output back to the
# model, so at best it landed on the next turn. UserPromptSubmit is the
# closest moment that is still BEFORE the reply, and its stdout does reach
# the session.
#
# IT ALSO CARRIES THE HARD REQUIREMENTS (2026-09-13). The blocking half of
# the reply gate reads each source's reply_check.json; the same file is
# printed here, verbatim, because a Stop hook fires after the reply has
# already been shown to the person -- so a refusal costs them the reply
# twice. The requirement has to arrive before the reply, not after it.
#
# BRIEF, not the full Rules, and that is a budget decision rather than a
# taste one: the reply gate's full text is thousands of tokens and this
# fires on every single prompt (practice: session-load-budget). One line per
# practice, resident ones skipped because they are in the loader block
# already, and a pointer to the full text for the session that needs it.
#
# IT PASSES THE TRANSCRIPT ON (2026-09-28), so the gate can say whether a
# size-conditioned requirement -- the Boildown's compact offer -- is owed in
# THIS reply, instead of telling the session to wait for a stop hook that
# never says. The hook's JSON payload names the transcript; stdin is read
# only when it is not a terminal, so a hand run does not hang.
#
# Exits 0 unconditionally — a UserPromptSubmit hook that exits non-zero eats
# the person's message.
